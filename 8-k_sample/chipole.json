Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excluded a $0.52 after-tax impact from expenses related to restaurant and corporate level impairment and closure costs, accelerated depreciation and corporate restructuring, partially offset by a reduction in contingencies related to certain legal proceedings, was $44.861, a 36.9% increase from $32.78.1", "blocks": [{"bbox": {"page": "1"}}]}, {"content": "·  Opened 271 new restaurants with 238 locations including a Chipotlane\n\n\"2023 was an outstanding year where we delivered strong transaction growth driven by throughput and menu innovation, opened a record number of new restaurants, surpassed $3 million in AUVs and formed our first international partnership,” said Brian Niccol, Chairman and CEO, Chipotle. “I am more confident than ever that we have the right people and the right strategy to achieve our long-term growth goals of reaching 7,000 restaurants in North America, $4 million in AUVs, expanding our industry leading margins and returns and furthering our purpose of Cultivating a Better World globally.”\n\n\n\n1 Restaurant level operating margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted net income, non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, adjusted depreciation and amortization, and non-GAAP effective income tax rate are non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures and further information are set forth in the table at the end of this press release.<hr /><hr />Results for the three months ended December 31, 2023:\n\nTotal revenue in the fourth quarter was $2.5 billion, an increase of 15.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in total revenue was driven by an 8.4% increase in comparable restaurant sales attributable to higher transactions of 7.4% and an increase in average check of 1.0%, and to a lesser extent, new restaurant openings. Digital sales represented 36.1% of total food and beverage revenue.\nWe opened 121 new restaurants during the fourth quarter with 110 locations including a Chipotlane. These formats continue to perform well and are helping enhance guest access and convenience, as well as increase new restaurant sales, margins, and returns.\nFood, beverage and packaging costs in the fourth quarter were 29.7% of total revenue, an increase of 40 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Food costs increased due to a higher mix of beef as well as inflation across the menu, most notably higher costs for beef, produce, and queso. These increases were partially offset by the benefit of menu price increases and, to a lesser extent, lower paper costs.\nRestaurant level operating margin in the fourth quarter was 25.4% compared to 24.0% in the fourth quarter of 2022. The improvement was primarily due to the benefit of sales leverage and, to a lesser extent, lower paper costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher inflation across several food costs and, to a lesser extent, wage inflation.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter were $169.2 million on a GAAP basis, or $170.0 million1 on a non-GAAP basis, excluding a $0.8 million reduction in contingencies related to certain legal proceedings.", "blocks": [{"bbox": {"page": "1"}}]}, {"content": "GAAP and non-GAAP general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter also include $122.0 million of underlying general and administrative expenses, $35.7 million of non-cash stock compensation, $10.1 million of higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes on equity vesting and exercises and $2.2 million of other costs, primarily related to our upcoming All Managers Conference scheduled for the first quarter of 2024.\nThe effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter was 26.2% compared to 26.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022. The slight decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to an increase in tax benefits from option exercises and equity vesting, partially offset by an increase in tax reserves and nondeductible expenses.\nNet income for the fourth quarter was $282.1 million, or $10.21 per diluted share, compared to $223.7 million, or $8.02 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding a $0.15 after-tax impact from expenses related to accelerated depreciation, partially offset by a reduction in contingencies related to certain legal proceedings, adjusted net income was $286.2 million1 and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $10.361.\nDuring the fourth quarter, our Board of Directors approved the investment of up to an additional $200 million, exclusive of commissions, to repurchase shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions. Including this repurchase authorization, $424.1 million was available as of December 31, 2023. The repurchase authorization may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. We repurchased $144.3 million of stock at an average price per share of $1,935.80 during the fourth quarter.\nResults for the full year ended December 31, 2023:\n\nTotal revenue for 2023 was $9.9 billion, an increase of 14.3% compared to 2022. The increase in total revenue was driven by a 7.9% increase in comparable restaurant sales attributable to higher transactions of 5.0% and an increase in average check of 2.9% and, to a lesser extent, new restaurant openings. Digital sales represented 37.4% of total food and beverage revenue.\nWe opened 271 new restaurants during 2023, bringing the total restaurant count at year-end to 3,437. Of the 271 new restaurants opened during the year, 238 locations included a Chipotlane. We had a total of 811 Chipotlanes as of year-end, which includes conversions of existing restaurants.\nFood, beverage and packaging costs for 2023 were 29.5% of total revenue, a decrease of 60 basis points compared to 2022.", "blocks": [{"bbox": {"page": "1"}}]}, {"content": "Food costs benefited from menu price increases and, to a lesser extent, lower avocado costs.

financial measures presented in the text above to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted net income is net income excluding expenses related to restaurant and corporate asset impairment, corporate restructuring, certain legal proceedings, stock-based compensation modification expense, unrealized gains on equity investments, separation costs, accelerated depreciation and certain other costs. Adjusted general and administrative expense is general and administrative expense excluding corporate restructuring expenses, certain legal proceedings, stock-based compensation modification expense, separation costs, and certain other costs. Adjusted depreciation and amortization is depreciation and amortization expense excluding certain accelerated depreciation expense. The adjusted effective income tax rate is the effective income tax rate adjusted to reflect the after tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments. Restaurant Level Operating Margin, a non-GAAP financial measure, is equal to the revenues generated by our restaurants less their direct operating costs which consist of food, beverage and packaging, labor, occupancy and other operating costs. This performance measure primarily includes the costs that restaurant level managers can directly control and excludes other costs that are essential to conduct our business. Management uses restaurant level operating margin as a measure of restaurant performance. Management believes restaurant level operating margin is useful to investors in that it highlights trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent to investors when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. We present these non-GAAP measures in order to facilitate meaningful evaluation of our operating performance across periods. These adjustments are intended to provide greater transparency of underlying performance and to allow investors to evaluate our business on the same basis as our management, which uses these non-GAAP measures in evaluating the company’s performance. Our adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted effective income tax rate and restaurant level operating margin measures may not be comparable to other companies’ adjusted measures. These adjustments are not necessarily indicative of what our actual financial performance would have been during the periods presented and should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, our results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
