We switched (authorized, cleared and settled) 126 billion payment transactions last year. Each and every one was supported with the highest levels of security. In the last three years, Mastercard prevented $30 billion in potential customer fraud losses through Al-powered systems that we have built and evolved over the years. Our recent acquisition of Baffin Bay Networks adds to this by helping to identify and mitigate cyber threats our customers might face.\n\nEmbrace new networks We're extending into adjacent spaces and networks to leave no white space uncontested. Open banking and digital identity present new opportunities to extend the value of our brand, both as standalone offerings and in synergy with our core payments capabilities.\n\nJust look at the continued growth in open banking - the secure, permissioned access to financial data - and the demand for lending use cases, among others. Our technology is helping to power a Pay by Bank offering, an ACH payment directly from a bank account wherever Mastercard is accepted. It starts with the consumer saying how and where they want to securely share their account information. And it has the potential to take the pain out of - and add security into - recurring payments such as rent, utilities and healthcare.\n\nSimilarly, our identity services activities are using consent-driven insights to help banks, merchants and other businesses determine if their \"customer\" is a genuine user or if it's a fraudster. We are providing risk-based analysis, peace of mind and brilliant customer experiences across transactions and other digital interactions like new account openings.\n\n## Defining new technology and value\n\nWe have come a long way from the creation of the Mastercard network. We have made it easier for our customers to connect with Mastercard for whatever their needs might be. Today, our hybrid approach blends legacy and cloud technologies to enable more innovation, deliver greater reliability and do so in a regulatory-compliant and sustainable manner.\n\nThe emerging technologies we're creating and constantly innovating enable new partners and power new opportunities through the agility and scale enabled by the cloud, the speed and intelligence in quantum computing, and the potential of blockchain.\n\nIt's our responsibility to ensure that these technologies can come together and solve real problems. This future of payments requires an equal focus on privacy and security, including a responsible approach to activate Al. Without that foundational trust, people will not embrace new technologies, potentially weakening the digital economy's growth."}

The Board exercises its direct oversight responsibility by meeting, at least annually, with management to discuss risk management processes and to assess the major risks impacting Mastercard The Board also considers management's risk analyses as it evaluates Mastercard's business strategy. Throughout the year, the Board and designated committees dedicate a portion of their regularly scheduled meetings to review and discuss specific risks in detail, including through the use of hypothetical risk scenarios and incident simulations. Strategic and operational risks are presented to and discussed with the Board and its committees by the executive officers, the Chief Legal Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and General Auditor\n\n- Audit Committee. The Audit Committee oversees risk management policies and processes by periodically meeting with management, the General Auditor and our independent registered public accounting firm for discussions regarding risk. The Audit Committee coordinates with the Risk Committee in its risk management oversight responsibilities. The Audit Committee is regularly provided updates on material legal matters. In addition to the General Auditor, the Chief Compliance Officer has functional reporting to the committee. The Audit Committee reports to the Board on the status of the company's internal controls and approves internal and external audit plans based on a risk-based methodology and evaluation. The Audit Committee oversees risks relating to financial statements and financial reporting and controls, including liquidity, settlement and counterparty risks."}
