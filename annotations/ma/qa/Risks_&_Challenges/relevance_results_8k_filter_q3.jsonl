Excluding the impact of Second Quarter Special Items, adjusted net revenue also increased 14%, or 15% on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was attributable to our payment network and our value-added services and solutions.\n\n\t- Payment network net revenue increased 13%, or 14% on a currency-neutral basis. Primary drivers of the increase were as follows:\n\n\t\t- Gross dollar volume growth of 12%, on a local currency basis, to $2.3 trillion.\n\n\t\t- Cross-border volume growth of 24% on a local currency basis.\n\n\t\t- Switched transactions growth of 17%.\n\n\t- These increases include growth in payment network rebates and incentives provided to customers. Payment network rebates and incentives increased 22% as reported and on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to an increase in our key drivers as well as new and renewed deals.\n\n\t- Value-added services and solutions net revenue increased 16% as reported and on a currency- neutral basis. The increase was driven primarily by the continued growth of our cyber and intelligence solutions, driven by our underlying driver growth and demand for our fraud and security solutions, and continued strong demand for consulting and marketing services, partially offset by other solutions.\n\n- Total operating expenses increased 5%. Excluding the impact of Second Quarter Special Items, adjusted operating expenses increased 12%, or 13% on a currency-neutral basis. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs.\n\n- Other income (expense) was favorable $268 million versus the year ago period, primarily due to net gains in the current year versus the net losses in the prior year related to unrealized fair market value adjustments on marketable securities. Adjusted other income (expense) was favorable $29 million versus the prior year, primarily due to an increase in our investment income, partially offset by increased interest expense related to our 2022 and 2023 debt issuances.\n\n- The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2023 was 23.2%, versus 18.7% for the comparable period in 2022. The adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2023 was 23.9%, versus 18.8% for the comparable period in 2022, primarily due to a $212 million discrete tax expense to establish a valuation allowance associated with the U.S. foreign tax credit carryforward deferred tax asset resulting from foreign tax legislation enacted in Brazil in the current period. The U.K. statutory tax rate increase, effective in 2023, also contributed to the higher as reported and as adjusted effective income tax rates for the current period.\n\n- As of June 30, 2023, the Company's customers had issued 3.2 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards."}
