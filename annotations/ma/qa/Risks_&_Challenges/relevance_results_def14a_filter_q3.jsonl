Mastercard is a uniquely well-diversified business across geographies, customer segments, products and services. That has helped US to create value and to be a constant, reliable resource through economic cycles and geopolitical changes.\n\nMastercard is leading today's digital evolution, enabling a broader set of payment flows, critical services and digital tools in more places. We're delivering better experiences, helping to speed up commerce, grow local economies and support more resilient communities. We're making commerce safer and smarter by building new tools in cybersecurity, biometrics, personalization and sustainability.\n\nOur teams have shown time and again the flexibility, commitment and know-how to grow our business and navigate through uncertainty. They take the foundations of our franchise and rules and evolve for today's needs. Our results prove it.\n\nLast year, Mastercard was recognized as one of only seven all-star companies in The Wall Street Journal-Drucker Institute Best Managed Companies list and we again led our industry in the IMD Future Readiness list. We celebrated the 25th anniversary of Priceless, a key differentiator for our brand and our business. We were recognized for our world-changing ideas, as a great place to work, and as one of the world's most ethical companies.\n\nAs we reported this past January, 2022 was a strong year that brought significant momentum into the new year. We grew gross dollar volume (GDV) on our network in 2022, rising 12% to $8.2 trillion. That growth includes how our teams drove the business to make up for any impacts from the suspension of our Russian operations. Cross-border volume increased 45% Last year, we surpassed 2 billion tokenized transactions a month across more than 110 countries.\n\nWith that as a foundation for 2023, here's how we plan to keep growing and deepening the digital economy all over the world:\n\n## Delivering on commitments"}

We switched (authorized, cleared and settled) 126 billion payment transactions last year. Each and every one was supported with the highest levels of security. In the last three years, Mastercard prevented $30 billion in potential customer fraud losses through Al-powered systems that we have built and evolved over the years. Our recent acquisition of Baffin Bay Networks adds to this by helping to identify and mitigate cyber threats our customers might face.\n\nEmbrace new networks We're extending into adjacent spaces and networks to leave no white space uncontested. Open banking and digital identity present new opportunities to extend the value of our brand, both as standalone offerings and in synergy with our core payments capabilities.\n\nJust look at the continued growth in open banking - the secure, permissioned access to financial data - and the demand for lending use cases, among others. Our technology is helping to power a Pay by Bank offering, an ACH payment directly from a bank account wherever Mastercard is accepted. It starts with the consumer saying how and where they want to securely share their account information. And it has the potential to take the pain out of - and add security into - recurring payments such as rent, utilities and healthcare.\n\nSimilarly, our identity services activities are using consent-driven insights to help banks, merchants and other businesses determine if their \"customer\" is a genuine user or if it's a fraudster. We are providing risk-based analysis, peace of mind and brilliant customer experiences across transactions and other digital interactions like new account openings.\n\n## Defining new technology and value\n\nWe have come a long way from the creation of the Mastercard network. We have made it easier for our customers to connect with Mastercard for whatever their needs might be. Today, our hybrid approach blends legacy and cloud technologies to enable more innovation, deliver greater reliability and do so in a regulatory-compliant and sustainable manner.\n\nThe emerging technologies we're creating and constantly innovating enable new partners and power new opportunities through the agility and scale enabled by the cloud, the speed and intelligence in quantum computing, and the potential of blockchain.\n\nIt's our responsibility to ensure that these technologies can come together and solve real problems. This future of payments requires an equal focus on privacy and security, including a responsible approach to activate Al. Without that foundational trust, people will not embrace new technologies, potentially weakening the digital economy's growth."}

A new MCC for gun and ammunition stores would allow banks to comply with their regulatory obligation to report suspicious purchasing activity associated with illegal activity, and credit card companies 2 would be able to voluntarily file this information under existing reporting systems. This could be accomplished without limiting or regulating gun sales or creating any additional burden to internal systems.\n\nSuspicious activity could include gun sales associated with diversion from legal to illegal markets, and purchasing behavior associated with mass shootings. Failure to act could lead to regulatory and reputational risk, including reputational risk associated with costly litigation.\n\nSuspicious purchasing activity that could constitute reportable suspicious activity might involve the frequency and size of purchases, and the type of retailer. For example, the Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooter used a Mastercard issued to purchase $11,000 worth of weapons and military gear in the six weeks, including purchases at two standalone gun stores. 1 One week before the mass shooting at the Pulse Nightclub, in which 49 people were killed and 50 injured, the shooter used a Mastercard (among others) to purchase more than $26,000 worth of guns and ammunition, including purchases at a stand-alone gun retailer. 2\n\nAn application to create an MCC for gun and ammunition stores was twice denied. It has been reported that Mastercard pushed back on the application and that \"credit card industry employees were part of an internal committee within ISO that recommended the application's rejection.\"3 \"3\n\nShareholders would benefit from transparency on how Mastercard's Board of Directors is overseeing any final position taken on any MCC application for standalone gun and ammunition stores, and whether Mastercard is appropriately considering the risks inherent in failing to take action to report suspicious purchasing activity at these retailers.\n\nWe believe that failure to do SO will result in lost lives, as well as regulatory, reputational, and litigation risks that may threaten long-term shareholder value.\n\nWe urge you to vote FOR this proposal."}
