That has helped US to create value and to be a constant, reliable resource through economic cycles and geopolitical changes.\n\nMastercard is leading today's digital evolution, enabling a broader set of payment flows, critical services and digital tools in more places. We're delivering better experiences, helping to speed up commerce, grow local economies and support more resilient communities. We're making commerce safer and smarter by building new tools in cybersecurity, biometrics, personalization and sustainability.\n\nOur teams have shown time and again the flexibility, commitment and know-how to grow our business and navigate through uncertainty. They take the foundations of our franchise and rules and evolve for today's needs. Our results prove it.\n\nLast year, Mastercard was recognized as one of only seven all-star companies in The Wall Street Journal-Drucker Institute Best Managed Companies list and we again led our industry in the IMD Future Readiness list. We celebrated the 25th anniversary of Priceless, a key differentiator for our brand and our business. We were recognized for our world-changing ideas, as a great place to work, and as one of the world's most ethical companies.\n\nAs we reported this past January, 2022 was a strong year that brought significant momentum into the new year. We grew gross dollar volume (GDV) on our network in 2022, rising 12% to $8.2 trillion. That growth includes how our teams drove the business to make up for any impacts from the suspension of our Russian operations. Cross-border volume increased 45% Last year, we surpassed 2 billion tokenized transactions a month across more than 110 countries.\n\nWith that as a foundation for 2023, here's how we plan to keep growing and deepening the digital economy all over the world:\n\n## Delivering on commitments"}

It is the core of what we deliver in expanded relationships with partners and customers including Citizens Bank, Santander and NatWest. This consumer card business continues to be healthy. There's plenty of runway ahead - in both the consumer and commercial segments - as seen in the continued shift to electronic payments.\n\nPeople are looking for more opportunities to tap into the convenience and safety they associate with Mastercard While it may seem like you can use a card virtually everywhere, our work on acceptance is never finished. In the past six years, the number of merchants accepting Mastercard payments has more than doubled - to nearly 100 million locations. We are growing through Cloud Commerce, a cloud-native service that makes it easy for the smallest business to start accepting payments without an investment in new hardware.\n\nHowever, we also recognize there's not a one-size-fits-all approach. There are areas where a card payment may not be the best fit. That's why we are working to support the range of ways people and businesses want to pay and get paid.\n\nIt comes down to being simple, frictionless and secure in every instance. We're doing that in consumer card payments and by focusing on four additional flows - disbursements and remittances, commercial point of sale, business-to- business accounts payable and consumer bill payments. These areas are increasingly becoming a larger part of our business with more growth potential - an estimated $80 trillion in GDV.\n\nIn commercial, we're building on a strong foundation and expanding into small business, travel and entertainment, and fleet cards - similar to programs people use in their personal lives but with tailored benefits for their business.\n\nMastercard Send and our cross-border services expand our ability to deliver domestic and international payments securely to 90% of the world's population. There's also our industry-leading work with virtual cards, providing businesses with an effective solution to do more with their capital and their data."}

This does not include state lobbying, where Mastercard lobbied in at least 18 states in 2021. Mastercard also lobbies abroad, spending approximately €900,000 on lobbying in Europe for 2021. Mastercard's lobbying over swipe fees amid surging inflation has attracted media scrutiny. 1\n\nCompanies can give unlimited amounts to third party groups that spend millions on lobbying and undisclosed grassroots activity. Mastercard fails to 2 disclose its payments to trade associations and social welfare groups, or the amounts used for lobbying, to stockholders.\n\nMastercard belongs to the American Bankers Association (ABA), Business Roundtable, and US Chamber of Commerce, which together spent $105 controversial nonprofit State Financial Officers Foundation, which is million on lobbying for 2021, and has drawn attention for funding the 3\n\n1 tps://thehill.com/lobbying/3477263-senators-grill-visa-mastercard-execs-over-swipe-fees,\n2 https://theintercept.com/2019/08/06/business-group-spending-on-lobbying-in-washington-is-at-least-double-whats-publicly-reported/\n\n3\n\nhtps://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/05/climate/republican-treasurers-climate-change.html\n\n127\n\nattacking so-called woke capitalism. 4 And while Mastercard does not belong to the American Legislative Exchange Council, which has drafted anti-woke boycott bills, 5 ABA supported its 2022 annual meeting 6 and the Chamber sits on its Private Enterprise Advisory Council.\n\nMastercard's lack of disclosure presents reputational risk when its lobbying contradicts company public positions. Mastercard supports addressing climate change, yet the Business Roundtable lobbied against the Inflation Reduction Act and the Chamber opposed the Paris climate accord. Mastercard is committed to diversity, equity and inclusion, yet the Chamber lobbied against protecting voting rights.\n\nI believe it is a risk our company does not disclose its third-party payments, and I urge Mastercard to expand its lobbying disclosure.\n\n## The Board's Statement in Response\n\nThe Board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons.\n\nWe already provide meaningful disclosure about our lobbying activity on our website. The Political Activity and Public Policy Statement located under the Corporate Governance section of our website provides comprehensive disclosure that is already responsive to the request in the proposal, including all of the information set forth below:\n\n- Our policies and procedures governing our participation in the political process, including our Policy on Political Contributions.\n\n- Information on the criteria Mastercard uses to decide whether to engage in the political process through political contributions at the state or local level.\n\n- A discussion of our participation and membership in trade associations, including the reasons we believe it is important to maintain a membership with a variety of trade associations and industry organizations."}
