The Board exercises its direct oversight responsibility by meeting, at least annually, with management to discuss risk management processes and to assess the major risks impacting Mastercard The Board also considers management's risk analyses as it evaluates Mastercard's business strategy. Throughout the year, the Board and designated committees dedicate a portion of their regularly scheduled meetings to review and discuss specific risks in detail, including through the use of hypothetical risk scenarios and incident simulations. Strategic and operational risks are presented to and discussed with the Board and its committees by the executive officers, the Chief Legal Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and General Auditor\n\n- Audit Committee. The Audit Committee oversees risk management policies and processes by periodically meeting with management, the General Auditor and our independent registered public accounting firm for discussions regarding risk. The Audit Committee coordinates with the Risk Committee in its risk management oversight responsibilities. The Audit Committee is regularly provided updates on material legal matters. In addition to the General Auditor, the Chief Compliance Officer has functional reporting to the committee. The Audit Committee reports to the Board on the status of the company's internal controls and approves internal and external audit plans based on a risk-based methodology and evaluation. The Audit Committee oversees risks relating to financial statements and financial reporting and controls, including liquidity, settlement and counterparty risks."}
