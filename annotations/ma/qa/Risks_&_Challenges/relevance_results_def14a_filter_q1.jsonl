Other payment network companies across the industry took the same action.\n\nMastercard has publicly stated that the pause in implementation is necessary to ensure that we take the appropriate time to understand this evolving legal situation, including the requirements and obligations of the company and its customers. Given the dynamic and evolving nature of these state actions, and the possibility of additional state legislation and federal legislation as well, it is only prudent for US to understand the nuances and implications on all network participants before determining how we might move forward with the implementation of the MCC.\n\nOur Board is aware of these developments, including our initial adoption of the new MCC and the current pause for implementation, as the company continues to monitor and manage the related risks involved. As indicated in the proxy statement, given the importance and sensitivity of these issues, we report regularly to our Board and certain of its committees on data privacy, protection and security, and network integrity matters. Through these management reports, the Board oversees and guides management about the role of the company in areas that require synthesized, thoughtful consideration, including in connection with the topic of firearms transactions.\n\nMastercard continues to engage with key stakeholders regarding concerns over gun violence and to take a vigorous approach to ensuring that only lawful purchases are permitted on our network. Mastercard recognizes that the epidemic of gun violence in the U.S. is an issue that has greater attention and the priority of many of our stockholders. We are committed to working with policymakers and elected officials to contribute to constructive solutions that address the gun violence issue and have called upon elected officials to enact meaningful policies in this area. We engage with these officials because we believe that it is the responsibility of legislators to address the issue of gun violence. We have also funded important initiatives with partners, including targeted merchant education about certain risks, such as \"strawman\" purchases and suicide prevention."}
