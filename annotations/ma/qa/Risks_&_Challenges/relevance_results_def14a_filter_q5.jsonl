(cont.)\n\ncustomers, through an update to the Customer Announcement, that the work on implementing the new MCC had been paused. Other payment network companies across the industry took the same action.\n\nMastercard has publicly stated that the pause in implementation is necessary to ensure that we take the appropriate time to understand this evolving legal situation, including the requirements and obligations of the company and its customers. Given the dynamic and evolving nature of these state actions, and the possibility of additional state legislation and federal legislation as well, it is only prudent for US to understand the nuances and implications on all network participants before determining how we might move forward with the implementation of the MCC.\n\nOur Board is aware of these developments, including our initial adoption of the new MCC and the current pause for implementation, as the company continues to monitor and manage the related risks involved. As indicated in the proxy statement, given the importance and sensitivity of these issues, we report regularly to our Board and certain of its committees on data privacy, protection and security, and network integrity matters. Through these management reports, the Board oversees and guides management about the role of the company in areas that require synthesized, thoughtful consideration, including in connection with the topic of firearms transactions.\n\nMastercard continues to engage with key stakeholders regarding concerns over gun violence and to take a vigorous approach to ensuring that only lawful purchases are permitted on our network. Mastercard recognizes that the epidemic of gun violence in the U.S. is an issue that has greater attention and the priority of many of our stockholders. We are committed to working with policymakers and elected officials to contribute to constructive solutions that address the gun violence issue and have called upon elected officials to enact meaningful policies in this area. We engage with these officials because we believe that it is the responsibility of legislators to address the issue of gun violence. We have also funded important initiatives with partners, including targeted merchant education about certain risks, such as \"strawman\" purchases and suicide prevention."}

This does not include state lobbying, where Mastercard lobbied in at least 18 states in 2021. Mastercard also lobbies abroad, spending approximately €900,000 on lobbying in Europe for 2021. Mastercard's lobbying over swipe fees amid surging inflation has attracted media scrutiny. 1\n\nCompanies can give unlimited amounts to third party groups that spend millions on lobbying and undisclosed grassroots activity. Mastercard fails to 2 disclose its payments to trade associations and social welfare groups, or the amounts used for lobbying, to stockholders.\n\nMastercard belongs to the American Bankers Association (ABA), Business Roundtable, and US Chamber of Commerce, which together spent $105 controversial nonprofit State Financial Officers Foundation, which is million on lobbying for 2021, and has drawn attention for funding the 3\n\n1 tps://thehill.com/lobbying/3477263-senators-grill-visa-mastercard-execs-over-swipe-fees,\n2 https://theintercept.com/2019/08/06/business-group-spending-on-lobbying-in-washington-is-at-least-double-whats-publicly-reported/\n\n3\n\nhtps://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/05/climate/republican-treasurers-climate-change.html\n\n127\n\nattacking so-called woke capitalism. 4 And while Mastercard does not belong to the American Legislative Exchange Council, which has drafted anti-woke boycott bills, 5 ABA supported its 2022 annual meeting 6 and the Chamber sits on its Private Enterprise Advisory Council.\n\nMastercard's lack of disclosure presents reputational risk when its lobbying contradicts company public positions. Mastercard supports addressing climate change, yet the Business Roundtable lobbied against the Inflation Reduction Act and the Chamber opposed the Paris climate accord.

The Political Activity and Public Policy Statement located under the Corporate Governance section of our website provides comprehensive disclosure that is already responsive to the request in the proposal, including all of the information set forth below:\n\n- Our policies and procedures governing our participation in the political process, including our Policy on Political Contributions.\n\n- Information on the criteria Mastercard uses to decide whether to engage in the political process through political contributions at the state or local level.\n\n- A discussion of our participation and membership in trade associations, including the reasons we believe it is important to maintain a membership with a variety of trade associations and industry organizations."}
