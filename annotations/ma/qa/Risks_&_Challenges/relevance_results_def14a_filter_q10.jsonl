Today, the Mastercard Way focuses on three areas -- creating value, growing together and moving fast, all with a foundation of doing the right thing.\n\nOur 29,900 colleagues across the globe have diverse backgrounds and experiences, but they all are mission-driven, talented and passionate people.

That's why our significant commitment to sustainable economies and social impact is necessary. Addressing our environmental impacts and enabling financial inclusion are smart for our business and are the right thing to do for society. They give people full access to their money. They bring a farmer's crops to a wider digital marketplace. They help with greater connectivity and allow more people to participate in today's economy, no matter where they are.\n\nThat strengthens the resilience of our communities, grows prosperity and delivers long-term value creation with new customers.

I believe in our long-term growth potential because of our differentiated strategy, people, production and solutions.\n\nEarlier, I talked about our momentum coming into this year. We are using that to our advantage - to reinforce our value to our customers, to deliver on our commitments and to imagine new ways to apply our skills, creativity and experience.\n\nOur ambition is to power\neconomies and empower\npeople. Our activities and\nprograms enable a stronger\necosystem that helps US all be\nmore resilient to whatever lies\nahead.\n\nIt's what we have continually committed to. It's what we have consistently delivered on. That track record is what makes Mastercard valuable and integral to our partners. Our ambition is to power economies and empower people. Our activities and programs enable a stronger ecosystem that helps US all be more resilient to whatever lies ahead.\n\nThat is why I'm optimistic about our future.\n\nThank you for your continued support.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nMichael Miebach\nPresident and CEO\n\n7"}

ESG matters are fundamental to our business strategy, and we leverage our employees, technology, resources, partnerships and expertise to drive positive, lasting impact. Our ESG strategy is expressed through three pillars - People, Prosperity, Planet - and all the work we do is grounded in strong governance principles. Our commitment to environmental and social responsibility - and our core value of operating ethically, responsibly and with decency - is directly connected to our continuing success as a business.\n\n## People\n\n## Prosperity\n\n- Talent attraction, development and\nwell-being\n\n- Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)\n\n## Planet\n\nFinancial inclusion of individuals and\nsmall businesses\n\n- Operational environmental footprint\n\n- Environmentally focused solutions\n\n## Governance principles\n\nResponsible and secure use of data\nEthical behavior\n\n## Our progress on key ESG goals in 2022\n\n- Toward our goal to close the global gender median pay gap at Mastercard, in 2022, we increased the median pay for female employees to 94.0% of median pay for male employees, up 0.8% from 2021. 1 Females continue to earn $1 for every $1 males earn, with the median pay gap predominantly due to the fact that we have more men in senior roles, not because men are paid more\n\nToward our goal to connect 1 billion people to the digital economy by 2025, we worked with our partners to connect more than 100 million in 2022. Since 2015, with partners, we have connected more than 780 million people to the digital economy\n\n- Toward our goal to grow U.S. Black leadership at the vice president level and above at Mastercard by 50% by 2025, we grew the number of Black leaders at the vice president level and above from 62 to 72 in 2022. Since 2020, the percentage of Black representation in leadership at the vice president level and above has grown by 7%\n\nToward our goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, and our science-based targets of 38% absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and 20% absolute reduction in Scope 3 GHG emissions by 2025 from our 2016 base year, in 2022, we reduced emissions by 44% and 40%, respectively, from our 2016 base year\n\n1 The gender pay gap shown above uses a 2021 baseline pay gap of 93.2%. The resulting 2022 pay gap of 94.0% (+0.8 ppt) uses data as of September 30, 2022 and neutralizes for currency fluctuations over the measurement period by using 2021 FX rates.\n\n57\n\n# ESG governance\n\nSustainability at Mastercard is driven from the top by our Board of Directors and CEO and is embedded in every level of our company."}
