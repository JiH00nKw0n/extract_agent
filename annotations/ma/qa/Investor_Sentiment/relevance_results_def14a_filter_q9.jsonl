A new MCC for gun and ammunition stores would allow banks to comply with their regulatory obligation to report suspicious purchasing activity associated with illegal activity, and credit card companies 2 would be able to voluntarily file this information under existing reporting systems.

Failure to act could lead to regulatory and reputational risk, including reputational risk associated with costly litigation.\n\nSuspicious purchasing activity that could constitute reportable suspicious activity might involve the frequency and size of purchases, and the type of retailer. For example, the Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooter used a Mastercard issued to purchase $11,000 worth of weapons and military gear in the six weeks, including purchases at two standalone gun stores. 1 One week before the mass shooting at the Pulse Nightclub, in which 49 people were killed and 50 injured, the shooter used a Mastercard (among others) to purchase more than $26,000 worth of guns and ammunition, including purchases at a stand-alone gun retailer. 2\n\nAn application to create an MCC for gun and ammunition stores was twice denied.

As of the last week of April, 12 bills are pending, including conflicting legislation within some of the same states. Recently, three states - Idaho, Mississippi and West Virginia - enacted legislation that either prohibits use of the new MCC or imposes restrictions on its use.

Mastercard requires customers to comply with applicable laws, including laws relating to the purchase and sale of firearms. We levy financial penalties and suspend or terminate the licenses of customers based on specific incidents if a pattern of unlawful activity is identified.\n\nAs we pause the implementation of this MCC, we have and will continue to make clear: MCCs are one data point - the primary business of the merchant - that would not provide any insight on specific purchases or resolve these very important larger issues.\n\nAs Mastercard has reported on how it manages and governs its MCC standards and had previously committed to adopting ISO's new MCC for purchases made at standalone firearm stores, while pausing in light of complex legal and regulatory uncertainty for all payment network participants, we believe the report requested by the proposal concerning Board oversight of management's decision making regarding ISO's September 2022 decision to establish the MCC would not provide stockholders with any meaningful additional information.\n\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the Board recommends that stockholders vote AGAINST this proposal."}

Although directors have the power to adopt bylaw amendments, shareholders have the power to check that authority by repealing board-adopted bylaws. Directors should not amend the bylaws in ways that inequitably restrict shareholders' right to nominate directors. This resolution simply asks the board to commit not to amend the bylaws to deter legitimate efforts to seek board representation, without submitting such amendments to shareholders. We urge the Board not to further amend its advance notice bylaws until shareholders have at least voted on this proposal.\n\nBloomberg's Matt Levine speculates bylaws might require disclosure submissions \"on paper woven from unicorns' manes, 12 with requirements waived for the board's nominees. While Mr. Levine depicts humorous and exaggerated possibilities, some companies are adopting amendments clearly designed to discourage fair elections.\n\nDirectors of at least one company (Masimo Corp.) recently adopted bylaw amendments that could deter legitimate efforts by shareholders to seek\n\nboard representation through a proxy contest. Masimo's advance notice bylaws \"resemble the 'nuclear option' and offers a case study in how rational governance devices can become unduly weaponized,\" writes Lawrence Cunningham. 3 Directors of other companies are considering similar proposals.\n\nTo ensure shareholders can vote on any proposal that would impose inequitable restrictions, we urge a vote FOR Fair Elections.\n\n## To Enhance Shareholder Value, Vote FOR Fair Elections - Proposal 9"}
