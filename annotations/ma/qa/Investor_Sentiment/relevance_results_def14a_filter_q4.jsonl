Mastercard is a uniquely well-diversified business across geographies, customer segments, products and services. That has helped US to create value and to be a constant, reliable resource through economic cycles and geopolitical changes.\n\nMastercard is leading today's digital evolution, enabling a broader set of payment flows, critical services and digital tools in more places. We're delivering better experiences, helping to speed up commerce, grow local economies and support more resilient communities. We're making commerce safer and smarter by building new tools in cybersecurity, biometrics, personalization and sustainability.\n\nOur teams have shown time and again the flexibility, commitment and know-how to grow our business and navigate through uncertainty. They take the foundations of our franchise and rules and evolve for today's needs. Our results prove it.\n\nLast year, Mastercard was recognized as one of only seven all-star companies in The Wall Street Journal-Drucker Institute Best Managed Companies list and we again led our industry in the IMD Future Readiness list. We celebrated the 25th anniversary of Priceless, a key differentiator for our brand and our business. We were recognized for our world-changing ideas, as a great place to work, and as one of the world's most ethical companies.\n\nAs we reported this past January, 2022 was a strong year that brought significant momentum into the new year. We grew gross dollar volume (GDV) on our network in 2022, rising 12% to $8.2 trillion. That growth includes how our teams drove the business to make up for any impacts from the suspension of our Russian operations. Cross-border volume increased 45% Last year, we surpassed 2 billion tokenized transactions a month across more than 110 countries.\n\nWith that as a foundation for 2023, here's how we plan to keep growing and deepening the digital economy all over the world:\n\n## Delivering on commitments"}
{"category": "Investor Sentiment", "question": "What themes are investors emphasizing in feedback meetings with management?", "file_type": "DEF14A", "index": 3, "result_lines": ["# Powering economies and empowering people through good and challenging times (cont.)", "## Delivering on commitments (cont.)"], "translated_lines": ["# 좋은 시기와 어려운 시기를 통해 경제를 활성화하고 사람들에게 힘을 실어주기 (계속)", "## 약속 이행 (계속)"], "chunk": "# Powering economies and empowering people through good and challenging times (cont.)\n\n## Delivering on commitments (cont.)\n\nAt our investor day just over a year ago, we shared a strategy that is based on three central pillars -- to expand in payments, extend our services and embrace new networks.\n\nExpand in Payments For much of our history, Mastercard has been known for card payments. It is the core of what we deliver in expanded relationships with partners and customers including Citizens Bank, Santander and NatWest. This consumer card business continues to be healthy. There's plenty of runway ahead - in both the consumer and commercial segments - as seen in the continued shift to electronic payments.\n\nPeople are looking for more opportunities to tap into the convenience and safety they associate with Mastercard While it may seem like you can use a card virtually everywhere, our work on acceptance is never finished. In the past six years, the number of merchants accepting Mastercard payments has more than doubled - to nearly 100 million locations. We are growing through Cloud Commerce, a cloud-native service that makes it easy for the smallest business to start accepting payments without an investment in new hardware.\n\nHowever, we also recognize there's not a one-size-fits-all approach. There are areas where a card payment may not be the best fit. That's why we are working to support the range of ways people and businesses want to pay and get paid.\n\nIt comes down to being simple, frictionless and secure in every instance. We're doing that in consumer card payments and by focusing on four additional flows - disbursements and remittances, commercial point of sale, business-to- business accounts payable and consumer bill payments. These areas are increasingly becoming a larger part of our business with more growth potential - an estimated $80 trillion in GDV.\n\nIn commercial, we're building on a strong foundation and expanding into small business, travel and entertainment, and fleet cards - similar to programs people use in their personal lives but with tailored benefits for their business.\n\nMastercard Send and our cross-border services expand our ability to deliver domestic and international payments securely to 90% of the world's population. There's also our industry-leading work with virtual cards, providing businesses with an effective solution to do more with their capital and their data."}

We switched (authorized, cleared and settled) 126 billion payment transactions last year. Each and every one was supported with the highest levels of security. In the last three years, Mastercard prevented $30 billion in potential customer fraud losses through Al-powered systems that we have built and evolved over the years. Our recent acquisition of Baffin Bay Networks adds to this by helping to identify and mitigate cyber threats our customers might face.\n\nEmbrace new networks We're extending into adjacent spaces and networks to leave no white space uncontested. Open banking and digital identity present new opportunities to extend the value of our brand, both as standalone offerings and in synergy with our core payments capabilities.\n\nJust look at the continued growth in open banking - the secure, permissioned access to financial data - and the demand for lending use cases, among others. Our technology is helping to power a Pay by Bank offering, an ACH payment directly from a bank account wherever Mastercard is accepted. It starts with the consumer saying how and where they want to securely share their account information. And it has the potential to take the pain out of - and add security into - recurring payments such as rent, utilities and healthcare.\n\nSimilarly, our identity services activities are using consent-driven insights to help banks, merchants and other businesses determine if their \"customer\" is a genuine user or if it's a fraudster. We are providing risk-based analysis, peace of mind and brilliant customer experiences across transactions and other digital interactions like new account openings.\n\n## Defining new technology and value\n\nWe have come a long way from the creation of the Mastercard network. We have made it easier for our customers to connect with Mastercard for whatever their needs might be. Today, our hybrid approach blends legacy and cloud technologies to enable more innovation, deliver greater reliability and do so in a regulatory-compliant and sustainable manner.\n\nThe emerging technologies we're creating and constantly innovating enable new partners and power new opportunities through the agility and scale enabled by the cloud, the speed and intelligence in quantum computing, and the potential of blockchain.\n\nIt's our responsibility to ensure that these technologies can come together and solve real problems. This future of payments requires an equal focus on privacy and security, including a responsible approach to activate Al. Without that foundational trust, people will not embrace new technologies, potentially weakening the digital economy's growth."}

Since 2020, the percentage of Black representation in leadership at the vice president level and above has grown by 7%\n\nToward our goal to connect 1 billion people to the digital economy by 2025, we worked with our partners to connect more than 100 million in 2022. Since 2015, with partners, we have connected more than 780 million people to the digital economy\n\nToward our goal of net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2040, and our science- based targets of 38% absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and 20% absolute reduction in Scope 3 GHG emissions by 2025 from our 2016 base year, in 2022, we reduced emissions by 44% and 40%, respectively, from our 2016 base year\n\n1\n\nThe gender pay gap shown above uses a 2021 baseline pay gap of 93.2%. The resulting 2022 pay gap of 94.0% (+0.8 percentage points (ppt)) uses data as of September 30, 2022 and neutralizes for currency fluctuations over the measurement period by using 2021 foreign exchange (FX) rates.\n\n16\n\n# Compensation"}

You can find more about this in \"About the Annual Meeting and voting\" on pg 138.\n\n## Refreshing the Board and nominating directors\n\nOur Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (NCG) reviews and selects candidates for nomination to our Board in accordance with its charter. Based on its review, coupled with our age and tenure limits, the NCG determines whether Board refreshment is needed in the near future. The NCG then identifies nominees who would be valuable assets to our Board and to Mastercard. Consistent with the limits of our bylaws, the size of our Board may fluctuate depending on our evolving strategic needs. As we identify individuals with the right talent and skills, we may seek to have them join our Board. As a result, you may see the Board size fluctuate over time.\n\nThe Board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote FOR each nominee to serve as director.\n\n\n\n## Identifying director candidates\n\nYou can find out more about our nomination process in the NCG's charter and our Corporate Governance Guidelines at https://investor.mastercard.com/ corporate-governance/board-committees/default.aspx"}

A new MCC for gun and ammunition stores would allow banks to comply with their regulatory obligation to report suspicious purchasing activity associated with illegal activity, and credit card companies 2 would be able to voluntarily file this information under existing reporting systems. This could be accomplished without limiting or regulating gun sales or creating any additional burden to internal systems.\n\nSuspicious activity could include gun sales associated with diversion from legal to illegal markets, and purchasing behavior associated with mass shootings. Failure to act could lead to regulatory and reputational risk, including reputational risk associated with costly litigation.\n\nSuspicious purchasing activity that could constitute reportable suspicious activity might involve the frequency and size of purchases, and the type of retailer. For example, the Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooter used a Mastercard issued to purchase $11,000 worth of weapons and military gear in the six weeks, including purchases at two standalone gun stores. 1 One week before the mass shooting at the Pulse Nightclub, in which 49 people were killed and 50 injured, the shooter used a Mastercard (among others) to purchase more than $26,000 worth of guns and ammunition, including purchases at a stand-alone gun retailer. 2\n\nAn application to create an MCC for gun and ammunition stores was twice denied.

Our commitment to inclusion is gimed at advancing our business, engaging our people, and supporting the societies we serve in the more than 210 countries and territories in which we conduct business. For over 15 years, we have drawn on our role in the payments ecosystem to drive financial inclusion and support the financial needs of small businesses and individuals. We drive innovation in a way that expands the middle class and helps the underserved with our goal of long-term financial security for all. These efforts open new markets for our business and create long-term customers. Our business thrives when these individuals and businesses prosper.\n\nWe continuously look for ways to innovate with inclusivity in mind. In October 2021, Mastercard introduced the Touch Card - an accessible card standard for the benefit of the 2.2 billion blind and partially sighted people around the world - enhancing access to the company's products and services while also providing the possibility of a greater sense of security, inclusivity and independence. Similarly, we have also pledged to support micro and small businesses, women entrepreneurs and Black communities.\n\nThese are just a few powerful examples of how Mastercard promotes diversity, equity and inclusion across our network, reflecting the principles we have adopted since our founding about using our network to connect people to opportunity, respecting individual customer choices and fostering a culture of decency. 2\n\nMastercard invests in diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace because we believe people thrive when they feel they belong, their ideas are valued and they are treated fairly. Mastercard is committed to creating a global corporate environment where all people are treated equally and fairly and have equal access to opportunities and advancement. For example, in 2021, our global pay equity ratio for women versus men was $1.00 to $1.00, and in the U.S., Black, Hispanic and Asian employees earn $1.00 for every $1.00 earned by white employees.\n\nWe also strive to develop a workforce and management and leadership teams that reflect the identities, experiences and perspectives of the more than 210 countries and territories we serve. Our Global Inclusion Report provides details regarding our approach to hiring. In 2021, the vast majority of our final candidate interviews in the U.S. included a person of color candidate and globally included a woman, and 51% of our new hires in the U.S. were people of color and 41% of our global new hires were women.
