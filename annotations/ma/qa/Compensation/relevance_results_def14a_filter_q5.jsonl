The Plan is a broad-based plan that provides an opportunity for eligible employees of the company and its designated subsidiaries and affiliates to purchase shares of the company's Class A common stock (referred to herein as \"shares\" or \"common stock\") through periodic payroll deductions at a discount from the then-current market price. The Plan does not provide for discretionary grants.\n\nIf approved by stockholders, a total of 10,000,000 shares will be made available for purchase under the Plan.\n\nApproval of the Plan by the stockholders will enable the company to offer a market-competitive, broad-based stock purchase plan to its employees and employees of its designated subsidiaries and affiliates. The Board believes that the Plan is in the best interests of the company and its stockholders because it will provide an important tool to attract, retain and reward the talented employees needed for our success. In addition, in encouraging share ownership by employees, the Plan will align the interests of employees and stockholders.\n\nStockholders are requested in this Proposal 4 to approve the Mastercard Incorporated Employee Stock Purchase Plan in substantially the form attached hereto as Appendix B. If stockholders do not approve this Proposal 4, then the Plan will not become effective.\n\nThe Board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote FOR the approval of the Mastercard Incorporated Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\n\n\n\n## Key features of the Plan\n\nThe principal features of the Plan are summarized below, but the summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Plan. A copy of the Plan is attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix B and is incorporated herein by reference.
