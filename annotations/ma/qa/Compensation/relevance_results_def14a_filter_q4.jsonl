Since 2020, the percentage of Black representation in leadership at the vice president level and above has grown by 7%\n\nToward our goal to connect 1 billion people to the digital economy by 2025, we worked with our partners to connect more than 100 million in 2022. Since 2015, with partners, we have connected more than 780 million people to the digital economy\n\nToward our goal of net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2040, and our science- based targets of 38% absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and 20% absolute reduction in Scope 3 GHG emissions by 2025 from our 2016 base year, in 2022, we reduced emissions by 44% and 40%, respectively, from our 2016 base year\n\n1\n\nThe gender pay gap shown above uses a 2021 baseline pay gap of 93.2%. The resulting 2022 pay gap of 94.0% (+0.8 percentage points (ppt)) uses data as of September 30, 2022 and neutralizes for currency fluctuations over the measurement period by using 2021 foreign exchange (FX) rates.\n\n16\n\n# Compensation"}
