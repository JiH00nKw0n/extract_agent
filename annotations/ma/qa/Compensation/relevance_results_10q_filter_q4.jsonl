MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\n\nNon-GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments which includes mark-to-market fair value adjustments, impairments and gains and losses upon disposition and the related tax impacts. Our non-GAAP financial measures also exclude the impact of special items, where applicable, which represent litigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items, as well as the related tax impacts (“Special Items”). We also present growth rates adjusted for the impact of currency which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that the non-GAAP financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of our operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods. We use non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. We excluded these Special Items because management evaluates the underlying operations and performance of the Company separately from these recurring and nonrecurring items. Net revenue, operating expenses, operating margin, other income (expense), effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share adjusted for the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, Special Items and/or the impact of currency, should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures for the comparable periods exclude the impact of the following:\n\nGains and Losses on Equity Investments\n\n•In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded net losses of $6 million ($5 million after tax, or an immaterial impact per diluted share) and $95 million ($63 million after tax, or $0.07 per diluted share), respectively, primarily related to unrealized fair market value adjustments on marketable and nonmarketable equity securities.\n\n•In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, we recorded net gains of $60 million ($66 million after tax, or $0.07 per diluted share) and net losses of $133 million ($114 million after tax, or $0.12 per diluted share), respectively, primarily related to unrealized fair market value adjustments on marketable and non-marketable equity securities.\n\nSpecial Items\n\nLitigation provisions\n\n•In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded charges of $231 million ($156 million after tax, or $0.16 per diluted share) primarily as a result of a change in estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation.\n\n•In the third quarter of 2022, we recorded charges of $208 million ($162 million after tax, or $0.17 per diluted share) as a result of developments in settlement discussions with certain U.K. merchants, including a settlement reached with one of those merchants.\n\n•In the second quarter of 2022, we recorded charges of $133 million ($89 million after tax, or $0.09 per diluted share) as a result of a change in estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation.\n\n34  MASTERCARD SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 FORM 10-Q"}
