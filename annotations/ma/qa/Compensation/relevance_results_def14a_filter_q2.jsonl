Accordingly, for 2022, the ratio of the compensation of our CEO to the compensation for our median employee was estimated to be 163 to 1.\n\nConsistent with last year, we used the following methodology to identify the median employee:\n\nWe\n\n- collected employee data of all employees globally, whether employed on a full-time, part-time or temporary basis as of December 31,\n\n2022\n\nWe\n\n31,\n\n2022\n\n- annualized the compensation of all new employees (other than temporary employees) who were hired by the company between January 1\nto reflect their estimated compensation over the entire year\n\nand\n\nDecember\n\n\t- We applied an exchange rate as of December 1, 2022 to convert all international currencies into U.S. dollars\n\n\t- We used total base pay and annual bonus target as of December 31, 2022 and actual long-term incentive award granted in 2022 as our consistently applied compensation measure\n\n\t- Three employees were originally identified as at the same median annual compensation level. As all three of these employees were new hires in 2022 (two having been hired as part of an acquisition), we selected as our median employee the employee with compensation immediately adjacent, and substantially identical to, that of the original median employees\n\n- We believe our pay ratio presented above is a reasonable estimate. As SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to use different methodologies, estimates and assumptions, our pay ratio may not be comparable with the pay ratios reported by other companies.
