We have established a framework for examining pay practices annually, supported by third-party analysis and benchmarked to the external market. We assess compensation decisions for potential pay disparities by gender (including base, bonus and long-term incentives), among other categories, and appropriately respond to any disparities that are found\n\n•Our employee incentive compensation plan features an ESG modifier for all employees that includes quantitative goals for a number of ESG items, including gender pay parity.\n\nWe expect to provide more detailed information in 2024 regarding our employees, including additional workforce demographics, in our annual Environmental, Social and Governance Report and Proxy Statement, both of which will be located on our website.\n\n1People of Color are defined as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Asian, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or two or more races. Ethnicity data does not include undeclared.\n\n2The gender pay gap is predominantly due to the fact that we have more men in senior roles, not because men are paid more.\n\nBrand\n\nOur family of well-known brands includes Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus. We manage and promote our brands and brand identities through advertising, promotions and sponsorships, as well as digital, mobile and social media initiatives, in order to increase people’s preference for our brands and usage of our products.
