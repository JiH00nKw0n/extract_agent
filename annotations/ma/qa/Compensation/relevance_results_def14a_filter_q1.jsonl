Our ESG strategy is expressed through three pillars - People, Prosperity, Planet - and all the work we do is grounded in strong governance principles. Our commitment to environmental and social responsibility - and our core value of operating ethically, responsibly and with decency - is directly connected to our continuing success as a business.\n\nTo help further align our actions with our ESG goals, and to help ensure all Mastercard employees share in the responsibility to uphold these goals, we link our annual incentive programs for executives and employees to ESG performance measures, including quantitative objectives for financial inclusion, gender pay equity and GHG emissions. See pg 73 of Compensation Discussion & Analysis for additional detail.\n\n## Our progress on key ESG goals in 2022\n\n\n\nPeople\n\n\n\n## Prosperity\n\n\n\n## Planet\n\n- Toward our goal to close the global gender median pay gap at Mastercard, in 2022, we increased the median pay for female employees to 94.0% of median pay for male employees, up 0.8% from 2021. 1 Females continue to earn $1 for every $1 males earn, with the median pay gap predominantly due to the fact that we have more men in senior roles, not because men are paid more\n\n- Toward our goal to grow U.S. Black leadership at the vice president level and above at Mastercard by 50% by 2025, we grew the number of Black leaders at the vice president level and above from 62 to 72 in 2022. Since 2020, the percentage of Black representation in leadership at the vice president level and above has grown by 7%\n\nToward our goal to connect 1 billion people to the digital economy by 2025, we worked with our partners to connect more than 100 million in 2022. Since 2015, with partners, we have connected more than 780 million people to the digital economy\n\nToward our goal of net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2040, and our science- based targets of 38% absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and 20% absolute reduction in Scope 3 GHG emissions by 2025 from our 2016 base year, in 2022, we reduced emissions by 44% and 40%, respectively, from our 2016 base year\n\n1\n\nThe gender pay gap shown above uses a 2021 baseline pay gap of 93.2%. The resulting 2022 pay gap of 94.0% (+0.8 percentage points (ppt)) uses data as of September 30, 2022 and neutralizes for currency fluctuations over the measurement period by using 2021 foreign exchange (FX) rates.\n\n16\n\n# Compensation"}

These reviews have resulted in a number of changes over the last several years.\n\nWe are asking stockholders to indicate their support for our NEO compensation as described in this proxy statement. This proposal, commonly known as a say-on-pay proposal, gives stockholders the opportunity to endorse or not endorse our executive compensation program.

Accordingly, we are asking stockholders to vote FOR the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:\n\n\"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to Mastercard's named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to the SEC rules, including the compensation discussion and analysis, compensation tables and any related narrative discussion, is hereby approved.\"\n\nBecause this vote is advisory, it will not be binding on Mastercard, the Board or the HRCC.

Compliance with ownership requirements and guidelines is reviewed by the HRCC annually. All NEOs have reached their ownership requirement with the exception of Mr. Froman, who is in compliance with the ownership policy by retaining 50% or more of the net shares received from each RSU and PSU vesting event.\n\nIn addition to the ownership requirements described above, an ownership guideline of one times base salary is in place for approximately 160 executives who are given five years from the time they are promoted or hired to comply with their guideline.\n\nIf the HRCC determines that an executive is not in compliance with his or her requirement or guideline, it may direct a larger percentage of the executive's future compensation into equity-based compensation.\n\n## Stock grant practices\n\nThe HRCC has adopted a policy with respect to equity awards that contains procedures to prevent stock option backdating or other timing issues. Under the policy, the HRCC has exclusive authority to grant equity awards to our Executive Officers. The policy provides that the HRCC will approve annual equity grants to employees at a meeting prior to March 1 of each year, with the dollar amount for such awards to be set at such meeting and grants to be made effective as of and with an exercise price reflecting the closing price of our Class A common stock on the NYSE on March 1 of each year. If March 1 falls on a weekend, the exercise price for any stock options granted will be the closing price of the stock on the last trading day prior to March 1. Grants of equity awards to new or newly promoted employees or for other special events may be made at other times in the year. These off-cycle grants are issued using an exercise price that reflects the closing price of our Class A common stock on the effective date of the grant."}

The HRCC believes that Mastercard's compensation program and policies do not create or encourage risk taking that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Mastercard\n\n86\n\nSeverance agreements All NEOs are covered by our standard severance and change in control plans for key executives.\n\nWhen making compensation decisions for the NEOs, the HRCC generally does not specifically consider the potential payments that may be made in the future to the NEOs in the event of termination of employment or in connection with a change in control. The severance plans govern the obligations of the parties following a termination of employment (either in connection with, or independent of, a change in control of Mastercard). In addition, Mastercard believes that severance payments provide an appropriate incentive for executives to comply with certain non-competition, non-solicitation and non-disclosure restrictions following a termination of employment. Moreover, the benefits provided to the NEOs in the event of termination of employment in connection with a change in control of Mastercard are designed to allow the executives to assess takeover bids objectively and to maintain their sole focus on keeping the interests of stockholders the top priority. You can find further discussion of these severance arrangements in the \"Potential payments upon termination or change in control\" section that follows this CD&A.\n\n## Tax implications - deductibility of executive compensation\n\nAs part of its role, the HRCC recognizes the limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The HRCC believes that its primary responsibility is to provide a compensation program that attracts, retains and rewards the executive talent needed for Mastercard's success and that a significant portion of our NEOs' compensation should continue to be tied to Mastercard's performance, even if the compensation is not necessarily tax deductible.\n\n# Compensation Committee report\n\nThe HRCC has reviewed and discussed the CD&A with management, and, based on such review and discussions, the HRCC recommended to the Board that the CD&A be included in this Proxy Statement, which has been incorporated by reference to Mastercard's 2022 Form 10-K.\n\n## Human Resources and Compensation Committee\n\nRichard K.
