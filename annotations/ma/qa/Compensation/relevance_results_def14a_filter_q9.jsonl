Our ESG strategy is expressed through three pillars - People, Prosperity, Planet - and all the work we do is grounded in strong governance principles. Our commitment to environmental and social responsibility - and our core value of operating ethically, responsibly and with decency - is directly connected to our continuing success as a business.\n\nTo help further align our actions with our ESG goals, and to help ensure all Mastercard employees share in the responsibility to uphold these goals, we link our annual incentive programs for executives and employees to ESG performance measures, including quantitative objectives for financial inclusion, gender pay equity and GHG emissions. See pg 73 of Compensation Discussion & Analysis for additional detail.\n\n## Our progress on key ESG goals in 2022\n\n\n\nPeople\n\n\n\n## Prosperity\n\n\n\n## Planet\n\n- Toward our goal to close the global gender median pay gap at Mastercard, in 2022, we increased the median pay for female employees to 94.0% of median pay for male employees, up 0.8% from 2021. 1 Females continue to earn $1 for every $1 males earn, with the median pay gap predominantly due to the fact that we have more men in senior roles, not because men are paid more\n\n- Toward our goal to grow U.S. Black leadership at the vice president level and above at Mastercard by 50% by 2025, we grew the number of Black leaders at the vice president level and above from 62 to 72 in 2022. Since 2020, the percentage of Black representation in leadership at the vice president level and above has grown by 7%\n\nToward our goal to connect 1 billion people to the digital economy by 2025, we worked with our partners to connect more than 100 million in 2022. Since 2015, with partners, we have connected more than 780 million people to the digital economy\n\nToward our goal of net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2040, and our science- based targets of 38% absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and 20% absolute reduction in Scope 3 GHG emissions by 2025 from our 2016 base year, in 2022, we reduced emissions by 44% and 40%, respectively, from our 2016 base year\n\n1\n\nThe gender pay gap shown above uses a 2021 baseline pay gap of 93.2%. The resulting 2022 pay gap of 94.0% (+0.8 percentage points (ppt)) uses data as of September 30, 2022 and neutralizes for currency fluctuations over the measurement period by using 2021 foreign exchange (FX) rates.\n\n16\n\n# Compensation"}

In February 2020, the HRCC determined that the payout rate for the 2020 PSUs would be tied to performance against three-year adjusted net revenue and adjusted EPS growth goals and modified by Mastercard's relative TSR performance against S&P 500 companies. Performance targets for our 2020 PSUs were set prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which created significant headwinds for our business, resulting in a below-target payout for 2020 PSUs.\n\nThe following table shows the performance assessment against the adjusted net revenue and adjusted EPS metrics:\n\n<table><tr><th>Measurement</th><th>Threshold 1</th><th>Target 1</th><th>Maximum 1</th><th>Actual</th><th>Score</th></tr><tr><td>Three-year adjusted net revenue CAGR2</td><td>11.2%</td><td>15.2%</td><td>20.2%</td><td>11,1%</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Three-year adjusted EPS CAGR³</td><td>14.2%</td><td>19.2%</td><td>23.2%</td><td>14.6%</td><td>54.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Average of net revenue and EPS score (pre-TSR score)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>27.0%</td></tr></table>\n\n1 PCE was 120 bps (basis points) above the forecast, and, as such, original adjusted net revenue and adjusted EPS minimum, target and maximum were each automatically adjusted upward by 120 bps accordingly. 2 Results shown differ from net revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) under GAAP because they exclude the impact of 2020-2022 acquisitions, translational and transactional impacts of foreign currency, and the related impact of our foreign exchange derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments. 3 Results shown differ from EPS CAGR under GAAP because they exclude 2020-2022 acquisitions, translational and transactional impacts of foreign currency, the related impact of our foreign exchange derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments, gain/loss on equity investments, litigation provisions, changes to U.S. tax legislation, and certain discrete tax and other one-time items.

Changes to our 2022 PSU program include:\n\n- Shift from the three-year compound annual growth rate targets for the financial components of the program to three individually set annual targets established at the onset of the three-year performance period expressed as a growth rate over the previous year's actual result.\n\n- Number of PSUs earned will be based on the actual annual performance averaged over a three-year period and subject to a three-year relative TSR modifier.\n\n- A financial metric payout cap that limits the number of shares earned for financial performance to 100% of target if performance against the three individually established annual growth targets yields an above-target payout while the three-year compound annual growth rate goal for each metric is not achieved.\n\n- Elimination of the design feature that automatically adjusts targets based on the variance between expected and actual Personal Consumption Expenditure over the three-year performance period.\n\nWe believe the new design creates a more sustainable alignment with stakeholder interests, preserving long-term focus on stockholder value while enhancing the company's ability to retain and engage leadership talent in volatile markets.\n\nForward-looking targets for our PSUs are not disclosed as doing SO could result in competitive harm and be detrimental to our operating performance. However, at the completion of the performance period, we retrospectively disclose the performance goals and payouts for all previously granted PSUs.\n\n## Stock options\n\nStock options represent approximately 20% of the annual long-term incentive grant value. We believe stock options are a form of performance-based incentive compensation because they require stock price appreciation to deliver value to the holder, thereby aligning compensation earned with the value stockholders receive over the same period of time. For 2022, stock option awards have an exercise price of $344.48 per share, which was the closing price of Class A common stock on the NYSE on March 1, 2022, vest in three equal annual installments beginning March 1, 2023 and have a maximum term of 10 years. Stock options are not eligible for dividends or dividend equivalents.\n\n## Restricted stock units\n\nRSUs represent approximately 20% of the annual long-term incentive grant. We believe RSUs help ensure a balanced LTI portfolio that effectively retains and engages our employees in a variety of market conditions. The number of RSUs granted was determined using a stock price of $340.68, which represents the closing stock price on the date of the grant, discounted by the expected dividend yield over the vesting period, and awards vest in three equal annual installments beginning March 1, 2023."}
