MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\n\nNon-GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments which includes mark-to-market fair value adjustments, impairments and gains and losses upon disposition and the related tax impacts. Our non-GAAP financial measures also exclude the impact of special items, where applicable, which represent litigation judgments and settlements and certain one-time items, as well as the related tax impacts (“Special Items”). We also present growth rates adjusted for the impact of currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that the non-GAAP financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of our operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods. We use non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. We excluded these items because management evaluates the underlying operations and performance of the Company separately from these recurring and nonrecurring items. Net revenue, operating expenses, operating margin, other income (expense), effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share adjusted for the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, Special Items and/or the impact of currency should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures for the comparable periods exclude the impact of the following:\n\nGains and Losses on Equity Investments\n\n•During 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recorded net pre-tax losses of $61 million ($36 million after tax, or $0.04 per diluted share), net pre-tax losses of $145 million ($126 million after tax, or $0.13 per diluted share) and net pre-tax gains of $645 million ($497 million after tax, or $0.50 per diluted share), respectively. These net gains and losses were primarily related to unrealized fair market value adjustments on marketable and nonmarketable equity securities. In addition, in 2021, net gains also included realized gains on sales of marketable equity securities.\n\nSpecial Items\n\nLitigation provisions\n\n•During 2023, we recorded pre-tax charges of $539 million ($376 million after tax, or $0.40 per diluted share) related to litigation provisions, which included pre-tax charges of:\n\n◦$344 million as a result of changes in the estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation, and\n\n◦$195 million as a result of settlements with a number of U.K. and Pan-European merchants.\n\n•During 2022, we recorded pre-tax charges of $356 million ($263 million after tax, or $0.27 per diluted share) related to litigation provisions, which included pre-tax charges of:\n\n◦$223 million as a result of settlements (both final and agreements in principle) with a number of U.K. merchants, and\n\n◦$133 million as a result of a change in estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation.\n\n•During 2021, we recorded pre-tax charges of $94 million ($74 million after tax, or $0.07 per diluted share) related to litigation settlements and estimated attorneys’ fees with U.K. and Pan-European merchants.\n\nRussia-related impacts\n\n•During 2022, we recorded a net pre-tax charge of $30 million ($24 million after tax, or $0.02 per diluted share), directly related to imposed sanctions and the suspension of our business operations in Russia. The net charge was comprised of general and administrative expenses of $67 million, primarily related to incremental employee-related costs and reserves on uncollectible balances with certain sanctioned customers. This charge was offset by net benefits of $37 million in net revenue, primarily related to a reduction in payment network rebates and incentives liabilities as a result of lower estimates of customer performance for certain customer business agreements due to the suspension of our business operations in Russia.\n\nIndirect tax matter\n\n•During 2021, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $88 million ($69 million after tax, or $0.07 per diluted share) to resolve a foreign indirect tax matter for 2015 through 2021 and the related interest expense. The charge was comprised of general and administrative expenses of $82 million and other income (expense) of $6 million.\n\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 50"}
