Changes to our 2022 PSU program include:\n\n- Shift from the three-year compound annual growth rate targets for the financial components of the program to three individually set annual targets established at the onset of the three-year performance period expressed as a growth rate over the previous year's actual result.\n\n- Number of PSUs earned will be based on the actual annual performance averaged over a three-year period and subject to a three-year relative TSR modifier.\n\n- A financial metric payout cap that limits the number of shares earned for financial performance to 100% of target if performance against the three individually established annual growth targets yields an above-target payout while the three-year compound annual growth rate goal for each metric is not achieved.\n\n- Elimination of the design feature that automatically adjusts targets based on the variance between expected and actual Personal Consumption Expenditure over the three-year performance period.\n\nWe believe the new design creates a more sustainable alignment with stakeholder interests, preserving long-term focus on stockholder value while enhancing the company's ability to retain and engage leadership talent in volatile markets.\n\nForward-looking targets for our PSUs are not disclosed as doing SO could result in competitive harm and be detrimental to our operating performance.
