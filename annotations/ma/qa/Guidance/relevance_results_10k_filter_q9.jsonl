FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nSince 2013, PSUs containing performance and market conditions have been issued. Performance measures used to determine the actual number of shares that vest after three years include net revenue growth, EPS growth and relative total shareholder return (“TSR”). Relative TSR is considered a market condition, while net revenue and EPS growth are considered performance conditions. The Monte Carlo simulation valuation model is used to determine the grant-date fair value.\n\nCompensation expense for PSUs is recognized over the requisite service period, or the date the individual becomes eligible to retire but not less than seven months, if it is probable that the performance target will be achieved and subsequently adjusted if the probability assessment changes. As of December 31, 2023, there was $34 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested PSUs. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nThe following table includes additional share-based payment information for each of the years ended December 31:"}
