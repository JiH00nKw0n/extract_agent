The base salary for each NEO is approved by the HRCC based on various factors, including the peer group data for each position and the assessment of the executive officer's contributions to Mastercard's performance.\n\nThe base salary for each executive officer is reviewed as part of the annual compensation decision-making process. Increases occur, at the HRCC's discretion, when the executive officer's base salary is not reflective of the desired market position or when a change in responsibility or individual contributions warrants an adjustment.\n\nAs part of the year-end compensation decision-making process, with input from its independent compensation consultant, the HRCC approved the following base salary increases effective March 1, 2022:\n\n- Michael Miebach: from $1,000,000 to $1,175,000\n\n- Sachin Mehra: from $650,000 to $750,000\n\n- Craig Vosburg: from $650,000 to $700,000\n\n- Michael Froman: from $650,000 to $675,000\n\n- Timothy Murphy: from $650,000 to $675,000"}
