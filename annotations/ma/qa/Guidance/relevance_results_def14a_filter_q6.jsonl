In early 2023, we're seeing the continued challenges of higher inflation and shocks to the banking industry.\n\nYet, I remain a pragmatic optimist. That's because I have seen just how resilient people can be, how quickly they can recover and the positive impact they can have. The payments industry has and will continue to play an important role in these efforts."}

It is the core of what we deliver in expanded relationships with partners and customers including Citizens Bank, Santander and NatWest. This consumer card business continues to be healthy. There's plenty of runway ahead - in both the consumer and commercial segments - as seen in the continued shift to electronic payments.\n\nPeople are looking for more opportunities to tap into the convenience and safety they associate with Mastercard While it may seem like you can use a card virtually everywhere, our work on acceptance is never finished. In the past six years, the number of merchants accepting Mastercard payments has more than doubled - to nearly 100 million locations. We are growing through Cloud Commerce, a cloud-native service that makes it easy for the smallest business to start accepting payments without an investment in new hardware.\n\nHowever, we also recognize there's not a one-size-fits-all approach. There are areas where a card payment may not be the best fit. That's why we are working to support the range of ways people and businesses want to pay and get paid.\n\nIt comes down to being simple, frictionless and secure in every instance. We're doing that in consumer card payments and by focusing on four additional flows - disbursements and remittances, commercial point of sale, business-to- business accounts payable and consumer bill payments. These areas are increasingly becoming a larger part of our business with more growth potential - an estimated $80 trillion in GDV.\n\nIn commercial, we're building on a strong foundation and expanding into small business, travel and entertainment, and fleet cards - similar to programs people use in their personal lives but with tailored benefits for their business.\n\nMastercard Send and our cross-border services expand our ability to deliver domestic and international payments securely to 90% of the world's population. There's also our industry-leading work with virtual cards, providing businesses with an effective solution to do more with their capital and their data."}

We switched (authorized, cleared and settled) 126 billion payment transactions last year. Each and every one was supported with the highest levels of security. In the last three years, Mastercard prevented $30 billion in potential customer fraud losses through Al-powered systems that we have built and evolved over the years. Our recent acquisition of Baffin Bay Networks adds to this by helping to identify and mitigate cyber threats our customers might face.\n\nEmbrace new networks We're extending into adjacent spaces and networks to leave no white space uncontested. Open banking and digital identity present new opportunities to extend the value of our brand, both as standalone offerings and in synergy with our core payments capabilities.\n\nJust look at the continued growth in open banking - the secure, permissioned access to financial data - and the demand for lending use cases, among others. Our technology is helping to power a Pay by Bank offering, an ACH payment directly from a bank account wherever Mastercard is accepted. It starts with the consumer saying how and where they want to securely share their account information. And it has the potential to take the pain out of - and add security into - recurring payments such as rent, utilities and healthcare.\n\nSimilarly, our identity services activities are using consent-driven insights to help banks, merchants and other businesses determine if their \"customer\" is a genuine user or if it's a fraudster. We are providing risk-based analysis, peace of mind and brilliant customer experiences across transactions and other digital interactions like new account openings.\n\n## Defining new technology and value\n\nWe have come a long way from the creation of the Mastercard network. We have made it easier for our customers to connect with Mastercard for whatever their needs might be. Today, our hybrid approach blends legacy and cloud technologies to enable more innovation, deliver greater reliability and do so in a regulatory-compliant and sustainable manner.\n\nThe emerging technologies we're creating and constantly innovating enable new partners and power new opportunities through the agility and scale enabled by the cloud, the speed and intelligence in quantum computing, and the potential of blockchain.\n\nIt's our responsibility to ensure that these technologies can come together and solve real problems. This future of payments requires an equal focus on privacy and security, including a responsible approach to activate Al. Without that foundational trust, people will not embrace new technologies, potentially weakening the digital economy's growth."}

As an organization, we place great emphasis on how we work together, deliver impact and, with that, ensure our resiliency.\n\nCulture can be a competitive advantage, and it is strongest when teams feel a powerful connection to each other and have shared goals and a clear path to grow and win. Today, the Mastercard Way focuses on three areas -- creating value, growing together and moving fast, all with a foundation of doing the right thing.\n\nOur 29,900 colleagues across the globe have diverse backgrounds and experiences, but they all are mission-driven, talented and passionate people. Whether they are engineers or programmers, product managers, consultants or finance specialists, they all are pulling toward a shared goal and common purpose.\n\n## Ensuring a sustainable social impact\n\nWe have the fundamental belief that businesses cannot thrive in an unhealthy and unequal world. That's why our significant commitment to sustainable economies and social impact is necessary. Addressing our environmental impacts and enabling financial inclusion are smart for our business and are the right thing to do for society. They give people full access to their money. They bring a farmer's crops to a wider digital marketplace. They help with greater connectivity and allow more people to participate in today's economy, no matter where they are.\n\nThat strengthens the resilience of our communities, grows prosperity and delivers long-term value creation with new customers. We are only one part of a much larger story, but I am proud of the role that we play with our partners across the public and private sectors.\n\n## Delivering on the vision, executing on our strategy\n\nYes, there are many external challenges, but there are also clear opportunities. I believe in our long-term growth potential because of our differentiated strategy, people, production and solutions.\n\nEarlier, I talked about our momentum coming into this year. We are using that to our advantage - to reinforce our value to our customers, to deliver on our commitments and to imagine new ways to apply our skills, creativity and experience.\n\nOur ambition is to power\neconomies and empower\npeople. Our activities and\nprograms enable a stronger\necosystem that helps US all be\nmore resilient to whatever lies\nahead.\n\nIt's what we have continually committed to. It's what we have consistently delivered on. That track record is what makes Mastercard valuable and integral to our partners. Our ambition is to power economies and empower people. Our activities and programs enable a stronger ecosystem that helps US all be more resilient to whatever lies ahead.\n\nThat is why I'm optimistic about our future.\n\nThank you for your continued support.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nMichael Miebach\nPresident and CEO\n\n7"}
