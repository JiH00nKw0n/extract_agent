BUSINESS\n\nNew Payment Flows\n\nWe offer platforms, products and applications that apply our multi-rail payment capabilities to capture new payment flows, enabling us to serve the needs of a significant addressable market.\n\nCommercial Point of Sale. We offer commercial credit, debit and prepaid payment products and solutions that meet the payment needs of large corporations, midsize companies, small businesses and government entities.

We offer solutions that enable businesses or governments to make payments to businesses with whom they have a trusted relationship for goods and services. Our solutions include Virtual Card Number (VCN), which is generated dynamically from a physical card and leverages the credit limit of the funding account. Our VCN solution may include the use of Mastercard InControlTM, our virtual card platform that allows buyers to pay suppliers using a one-time use card number that can be set with transaction level controls, providing unmatched configurability and flexibility.   Additionally, we offer a platform to optimize supplier payment enablement campaigns for financial institutions, as well as our treasury intelligence platform that provides corporations with recommendations to improve working capital performance and accelerate spend on cards. Key 2023 Developments\n •In 2023, we launched Mastercard Receivables Manager, a solution aimed at streamlining how suppliers receive virtual card payments by automating the integration of reconciliation data into suppliers’ accounts receivables systems.   •In 2023, our Disbursements and Remittances capabilities have the ability to reach more than 95% of the world’s banked population.\nDisbursements and Remittances. We offer applications that enable consumers, businesses, governments and merchants to send and receive money domestically and across borders with greater speed and ease, with a payout reach of approximately 10 billion endpoints globally across multiple channels, and in more than 180 markets and 150 currencies.  •Using Mastercard SendTM, we partner with digital messaging and payment platforms to enable consumers to send money directly within applications to other consumers. We partner with central banks, fintechs and financial institutions to help governments and nonprofits more efficiently enable, as applicable, distribution of social and economic assistance and business-to-consumer (“B2C”) disbursements across various use cases (such as wallet funding, cash payouts, gig worker payouts and insurance claims).\n\n•Mastercard Cross-Border Services enables a wide range of payment flows and use cases to customers (including trade payments, remittances and disbursements). These flows are enabled via a distribution network with a single point of access that allows financial institutions, fintechs and digital partners to send and receive money globally through multiple channels, including bank accounts, mobile wallets, cards and cash payouts.\n\nConsumer Bill Payments. Our solutions enable consumers and small businesses to pay their billers in a seamless and secure way.
