It is the core of what we deliver in expanded relationships with partners and customers including Citizens Bank, Santander and NatWest. This consumer card business continues to be healthy. There's plenty of runway ahead - in both the consumer and commercial segments - as seen in the continued shift to electronic payments.\n\nPeople are looking for more opportunities to tap into the convenience and safety they associate with Mastercard While it may seem like you can use a card virtually everywhere, our work on acceptance is never finished. In the past six years, the number of merchants accepting Mastercard payments has more than doubled - to nearly 100 million locations. We are growing through Cloud Commerce, a cloud-native service that makes it easy for the smallest business to start accepting payments without an investment in new hardware.\n\nHowever, we also recognize there's not a one-size-fits-all approach. There are areas where a card payment may not be the best fit. That's why we are working to support the range of ways people and businesses want to pay and get paid.\n\nIt comes down to being simple, frictionless and secure in every instance. We're doing that in consumer card payments and by focusing on four additional flows - disbursements and remittances, commercial point of sale, business-to- business accounts payable and consumer bill payments. These areas are increasingly becoming a larger part of our business with more growth potential - an estimated $80 trillion in GDV.\n\nIn commercial, we're building on a strong foundation and expanding into small business, travel and entertainment, and fleet cards - similar to programs people use in their personal lives but with tailored benefits for their business.\n\nMastercard Send and our cross-border services expand our ability to deliver domestic and international payments securely to 90% of the world's population. There's also our industry-leading work with virtual cards, providing businesses with an effective solution to do more with their capital and their data."}
