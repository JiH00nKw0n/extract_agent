Mastercard is a uniquely well-diversified business across geographies, customer segments, products and services. That has helped US to create value and to be a constant, reliable resource through economic cycles and geopolitical changes.\n\nMastercard is leading today's digital evolution, enabling a broader set of payment flows, critical services and digital tools in more places. We're delivering better experiences, helping to speed up commerce, grow local economies and support more resilient communities. We're making commerce safer and smarter by building new tools in cybersecurity, biometrics, personalization and sustainability.\n\nOur teams have shown time and again the flexibility, commitment and know-how to grow our business and navigate through uncertainty. They take the foundations of our franchise and rules and evolve for today's needs. Our results prove it.\n\nLast year, Mastercard was recognized as one of only seven all-star companies in The Wall Street Journal-Drucker Institute Best Managed Companies list and we again led our industry in the IMD Future Readiness list. We celebrated the 25th anniversary of Priceless, a key differentiator for our brand and our business. We were recognized for our world-changing ideas, as a great place to work, and as one of the world's most ethical companies.\n\nAs we reported this past January, 2022 was a strong year that brought significant momentum into the new year. We grew gross dollar volume (GDV) on our network in 2022, rising 12% to $8.2 trillion. That growth includes how our teams drove the business to make up for any impacts from the suspension of our Russian operations. Cross-border volume increased 45% Last year, we surpassed 2 billion tokenized transactions a month across more than 110 countries.\n\nWith that as a foundation for 2023, here's how we plan to keep growing and deepening the digital economy all over the world:\n\n## Delivering on commitments"}
