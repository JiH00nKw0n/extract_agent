The remaining increase was driven primarily by the continued growth of our cyber and intelligence solutions, driven by our underlying driver growth and demand for our fraud and security solutions, and strong demand for our consulting and marketing services, as well as our loyalty solutions.\n\n- Total operating expenses increased 11%. Excluding the impact of Year-to-date Special Items, adjusted operating expenses increased 11%, or 12% on a currency-neutral basis. This includes a 1 percentage point increase from acquisitions. The remaining increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs.\n\n- Other income (expense) was favorable $162 million, primarily due to lower net losses in the current year versus the prior year related to unrealized fair market value adjustments on marketable and non- marketable equity securities. Adjusted other income (expense) was favorable $59 million versus the year ago period, primarily due to an increase in our investment income, partially offset by increased interest expense related to our 2022 and 2023 debt issuances.\n\n- The effective tax rate for year-to-date 2023 was 20.6%, versus 11.9% for the comparable period in 2022. The adjusted effective tax rate for 2023 was 21.2%, versus 12.3% for the comparable period in 2022. The adjusted effective tax rate was higher in 2023 primarily due to a $212 million discrete tax expense to establish a valuation allowance in Q2 2023 on the remaining U.S. foreign tax credit carryforward deferred tax asset resulting from foreign tax legislation enacted in Brazil in the current period and the release of a $333 million valuation allowance in Q1 2022. The U.K. statutory tax rate increase, effective in 2023, also contributed to the higher effective income tax rate in 2023.\n\n## Return of Capital to Shareholders\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, Mastercard repurchased 6.5 million shares at a cost of $2.4 billion and paid $541 million in dividends.\n\nThrough the first half of 2023, Mastercard repurchased 14.4 million shares at a cost of $5.3 billion and paid $1.1 billion in dividends.\n\nQuarter-to-date through July 24, the Company repurchased 1.3 million shares at a cost of $497 million, which leaves $6.4 billion remaining under the approved share repurchase programs.\n\n## Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call Details\n\nAt 9:00 a.m. ET today, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its second quarter 2023 results.
