RISK FACTORS\n\nDisintermediation from stakeholders both within and outside of the payments value chain could harm our business.\n\nAs the payments industry continues to develop and change, we face disintermediation and related risks, including:\n\n•Parties that process our transactions in certain countries may try to eliminate our position as an intermediary in the payment process. For example, merchants could switch (and in some cases are switching) transactions directly with issuers. Additionally, processors could process transactions directly between issuers and acquirers. Large scale consolidation within processors could result in these processors developing bilateral agreements or in some cases switching the entire transaction on their own network, thereby disintermediating us.\n\n•Industry participants continue to invest in and develop alternative capabilities, such as account-based payments, which could facilitate P2M transactions that compete with both our core payment network and our additional payment capabilities.\n\n•Regulation (such as PSD2 in the EEA) may disintermediate issuers by enabling third-party providers opportunities to route payment transactions away from our network and products and towards other forms of payment by offering account information or payment initiation services directly to those who currently use our products. Such regulation may also provide these processors with the opportunity to commoditize the data that are included in the transactions they are servicing. If our customers are disintermediated in their business, we could face diminished demand for our products and services.\n\n•Although we partner with fintechs and technology companies (such as digital players and mobile providers) that leverage our technology, platforms and networks to deliver their products, they could develop platforms or networks that disintermediate us from digital payments and impact our ability to compete in the digital economy. These companies may also develop products or services that compete with our customers within the payments ecosystem and, as a result, could diminish demand for our products and services. When we do partner with fintechs and technology companies, we face a heightened risk when we share data as part of those relationships. While we share this data in a controlled manner subject to applicable anonymization and privacy and data standards, sharing this data without proper oversight could provide partners with a competitive advantage.\n\n•Competitors, customers, fintechs, technology companies, governments and other industry participants may develop products that compete with or replace products and services we currently provide to support our switched transaction and payments offerings. These products could either replace, or force us to change our pricing or practices, for these offerings. In addition, governments that develop or encourage the creation of national or international payments platforms may promote their platforms in such a way that could put us at a competitive disadvantage in those markets, or require us to compete differently.\n\n•Participants in the payments industry may merge, create joint ventures or form other business combinations that may strengthen their existing business services or create new payment products and services that compete with our products and services.\n\nOur failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\n\nContinued intense pricing pressure may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\n\nIn order to increase transaction volumes, enter new markets and expand our products and services, we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives, pricing discounts and other support that promote our products. In order to stay competitive, we may have to increase the amount of these incentives and pricing discounts so as to meet customer demand for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives, which moderates our growth. Our inability to switch additional transaction volumes or to provide additional services to our customers at levels sufficient to compensate for such lower fees or increased costs in the future could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations. In addition, increased pressure on prices increases the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives in areas other than those relating to customer incentives.\n\nIn the future, we may not be able to enter into agreements with our customers if they require terms that we are unable or unwilling to offer, and we may be required to modify existing agreements in order to maintain relationships and to compete with others in the industry. Some of our competitors are larger with greater financial resources and accordingly may be able to charge lower prices to our customers. In addition, to the extent that we offer discounts or incentives under such agreements, we will need to further increase transaction volumes or the amount of services provided in order to benefit from such agreements and to increase revenue and profit, and we may not be successful in doing so, particularly in the current regulatory environment. Our customers also may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment product marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability. These factors could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\n\nAdditionally, we face pricing pressure related to real-time account-based payment schemes and cross-border payments (including the increased use of domestic real-time account-based payment schemes offering increasingly lower or subsidized pricing for P2M transactions as well as continued downward pressure on pricing for cross-border payments resulting from competition from real-time account-based payment schemes and from initiatives to lower the cost of cross-border payments to end users (such as the G20\n\n32 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K"}

RISK FACTORS\n\n•Tightening of credit availability that could impact the ability of participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of our credit facility\n\nCross-border transactions. We switch substantially all cross-border transactions using Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards and generate a significant amount of revenue from cross-border volume fees and fees related to switched transactions. Revenue from switching cross-border and currency conversion transactions for our customers fluctuates with the levels and destinations of cross-border travel and our customers’ need for transactions to be converted into their base currency. Cross-border activity has, and may continue to be, adversely affected by world geopolitical, economic, health, weather and other conditions. These include or have included:\n\n•the global COVID-19 pandemic (and the potential of any post-pandemic global economic impact) and potential separate outbreaks of flu, viruses and other diseases (any of which could result in future epidemics or pandemics)\n\n•current and potential future geopolitical conflicts, as well as expansion into regional or global conflicts, and the resulting impacts to our business (this includes Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the actions taken by the U.S., the EU, other governments and Mastercard in response)\n\n•the threat of terrorism and major environmental and extreme weather events (including those related to climate change)\n\nThe impact of and uncertainty that could result from any of these events or factors could ultimately decrease cross-border activity. Additionally, any regulation of interregional interchange fees could also negatively impact our cross-border activity (for example, the targets announced by the G20 Financial Stability Board related to cross-border payments). In each case, decreased cross-border activity could decrease the revenue we receive.\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine. In addition to the cross-border impacts described above, our compliance with sanctions and our decision to suspend our business operations in Russia has led, and could further lead, to other legal ramifications and operational challenges, including fines, the nationalization of our subsidiary and any resulting impacts, and/or lawsuits.\n\nStandards. Our operations as a global payments network rely in part on global interoperable standards to help facilitate safe and simple payments. To the extent geopolitical events result in jurisdictions no longer participating in the creation or adoption of these standards, or the creation of competing standards, the products and services we offer could be negatively impacted.\n\nFactors such as those discussed above have adversely impacted our business, results of operations and financial condition, and any of these developments potentially could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\n\nAdverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could negatively impact our results of operations.\n\nDuring 2023, approximately 70% of our revenue was generated from activities outside the U.S. This revenue (and the related expense) could be transacted in a non-functional currency or valued based on a currency other than the functional currency of the entity generating the revenues. Resulting exchange gains and losses are included in our net income. Our risk management activities provide protection with respect to adverse changes in the value of only a limited number of currencies and are based on estimates of exposures to these currencies.\n\nIn addition, some of the revenue we generate outside the U.S. is subject to unpredictable currency fluctuations including devaluation of currencies where the values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar strengthens compared to currencies in which we generate revenue, this revenue may be translated at a materially lower amount than expected. Furthermore, we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion into U.S. dollars of our other revenue currencies and financial assets.\n\nThe occurrence of currency fluctuations or exchange controls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\n\nBrand, Reputational Impact and ESG\n\nNegative brand perception may materially and adversely affect our overall business.\n\nOur brands and their attributes are key assets of our business. The ability to attract consumers to our branded products and retain them depends upon the external perception of us and our industry:\n\n•Our business may be affected by actions taken by our customers, merchants or other organizations that impact the perception of our brands or the payments industry in general. From time to time, our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our brands, such as creditor practices that may be viewed as “predatory”. Moreover, adverse developments with respect to our industry or the industries of our customers or other companies and organizations that use our products and services (including certain legally permissible but high-risk merchant categories, such as adult content, firearms, alcohol and tobacco) may also, by association, impair our reputation, or result in greater public, regulatory or legislative scrutiny,\n\n38 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K"}
