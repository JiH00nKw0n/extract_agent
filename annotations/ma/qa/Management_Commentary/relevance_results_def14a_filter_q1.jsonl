Mastercard is a uniquely well-diversified business across geographies, customer segments, products and services. That has helped US to create value and to be a constant, reliable resource through economic cycles and geopolitical changes.\n\nMastercard is leading today's digital evolution, enabling a broader set of payment flows, critical services and digital tools in more places. We're delivering better experiences, helping to speed up commerce, grow local economies and support more resilient communities. We're making commerce safer and smarter by building new tools in cybersecurity, biometrics, personalization and sustainability.\n\nOur teams have shown time and again the flexibility, commitment and know-how to grow our business and navigate through uncertainty. They take the foundations of our franchise and rules and evolve for today's needs. Our results prove it.\n\nLast year, Mastercard was recognized as one of only seven all-star companies in The Wall Street Journal-Drucker Institute Best Managed Companies list and we again led our industry in the IMD Future Readiness list. We celebrated the 25th anniversary of Priceless, a key differentiator for our brand and our business. We were recognized for our world-changing ideas, as a great place to work, and as one of the world's most ethical companies.\n\nAs we reported this past January, 2022 was a strong year that brought significant momentum into the new year. We grew gross dollar volume (GDV) on our network in 2022, rising 12% to $8.2 trillion. That growth includes how our teams drove the business to make up for any impacts from the suspension of our Russian operations. Cross-border volume increased 45% Last year, we surpassed 2 billion tokenized transactions a month across more than 110 countries.\n\nWith that as a foundation for 2023, here's how we plan to keep growing and deepening the digital economy all over the world:\n\n## Delivering on commitments"}

It is the core of what we deliver in expanded relationships with partners and customers including Citizens Bank, Santander and NatWest. This consumer card business continues to be healthy. There's plenty of runway ahead - in both the consumer and commercial segments - as seen in the continued shift to electronic payments.\n\nPeople are looking for more opportunities to tap into the convenience and safety they associate with Mastercard While it may seem like you can use a card virtually everywhere, our work on acceptance is never finished. In the past six years, the number of merchants accepting Mastercard payments has more than doubled - to nearly 100 million locations. We are growing through Cloud Commerce, a cloud-native service that makes it easy for the smallest business to start accepting payments without an investment in new hardware.\n\nHowever, we also recognize there's not a one-size-fits-all approach. There are areas where a card payment may not be the best fit. That's why we are working to support the range of ways people and businesses want to pay and get paid.\n\nIt comes down to being simple, frictionless and secure in every instance. We're doing that in consumer card payments and by focusing on four additional flows - disbursements and remittances, commercial point of sale, business-to- business accounts payable and consumer bill payments. These areas are increasingly becoming a larger part of our business with more growth potential - an estimated $80 trillion in GDV.\n\nIn commercial, we're building on a strong foundation and expanding into small business, travel and entertainment, and fleet cards - similar to programs people use in their personal lives but with tailored benefits for their business.\n\nMastercard Send and our cross-border services expand our ability to deliver domestic and international payments securely to 90% of the world's population. There's also our industry-leading work with virtual cards, providing businesses with an effective solution to do more with their capital and their data."}

We switched (authorized, cleared and settled) 126 billion payment transactions last year. Each and every one was supported with the highest levels of security. In the last three years, Mastercard prevented $30 billion in potential customer fraud losses through Al-powered systems that we have built and evolved over the years. Our recent acquisition of Baffin Bay Networks adds to this by helping to identify and mitigate cyber threats our customers might face.\n\nEmbrace new networks We're extending into adjacent spaces and networks to leave no white space uncontested. Open banking and digital identity present new opportunities to extend the value of our brand, both as standalone offerings and in synergy with our core payments capabilities.\n\nJust look at the continued growth in open banking - the secure, permissioned access to financial data - and the demand for lending use cases, among others. Our technology is helping to power a Pay by Bank offering, an ACH payment directly from a bank account wherever Mastercard is accepted. It starts with the consumer saying how and where they want to securely share their account information. And it has the potential to take the pain out of - and add security into - recurring payments such as rent, utilities and healthcare.\n\nSimilarly, our identity services activities are using consent-driven insights to help banks, merchants and other businesses determine if their \"customer\" is a genuine user or if it's a fraudster. We are providing risk-based analysis, peace of mind and brilliant customer experiences across transactions and other digital interactions like new account openings.\n\n## Defining new technology and value\n\nWe have come a long way from the creation of the Mastercard network. We have made it easier for our customers to connect with Mastercard for whatever their needs might be. Today, our hybrid approach blends legacy and cloud technologies to enable more innovation, deliver greater reliability and do so in a regulatory-compliant and sustainable manner.\n\nThe emerging technologies we're creating and constantly innovating enable new partners and power new opportunities through the agility and scale enabled by the cloud, the speed and intelligence in quantum computing, and the potential of blockchain.\n\nIt's our responsibility to ensure that these technologies can come together and solve real problems. This future of payments requires an equal focus on privacy and security, including a responsible approach to activate Al. Without that foundational trust, people will not embrace new technologies, potentially weakening the digital economy's growth."}

As an organization, we place great emphasis on how we work together, deliver impact and, with that, ensure our resiliency.\n\nCulture can be a competitive advantage, and it is strongest when teams feel a powerful connection to each other and have shared goals and a clear path to grow and win. Today, the Mastercard Way focuses on three areas -- creating value, growing together and moving fast, all with a foundation of doing the right thing.\n\nOur 29,900 colleagues across the globe have diverse backgrounds and experiences, but they all are mission-driven, talented and passionate people.

That's why our significant commitment to sustainable economies and social impact is necessary. Addressing our environmental impacts and enabling financial inclusion are smart for our business and are the right thing to do for society. They give people full access to their money. They bring a farmer's crops to a wider digital marketplace. They help with greater connectivity and allow more people to participate in today's economy, no matter where they are.\n\nThat strengthens the resilience of our communities, grows prosperity and delivers long-term value creation with new customers.

I believe in our long-term growth potential because of our differentiated strategy, people, production and solutions.\n\nEarlier, I talked about our momentum coming into this year.

Their priorities were clear: to ensure the strong continuity of the business, deliver on the needs of customers and partners, and take care of the people that bring the strategy to life. The management team delivered on today's commitments with steady growth in every quarter. As importantly, Mastercard continued to make strong progress on creating further long-term value, devising innovative technology, advancing financial inclusion, meeting environmental goals, and maintaining the responsible use of data.\n\nMastercard has an obligation to its stockholders, employees and customers, but we also play a critical role in the lives of SO many people across the globe: connecting buyers and sellers, enabling everyday commerce, helping to power data- driven decisions and having a positive social impact.\n\nI am also proud of the commitment of the Board of Directors.
