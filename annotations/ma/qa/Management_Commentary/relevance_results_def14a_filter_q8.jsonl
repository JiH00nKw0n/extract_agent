It is the core of what we deliver in expanded relationships with partners and customers including Citizens Bank, Santander and NatWest. This consumer card business continues to be healthy. There's plenty of runway ahead - in both the consumer and commercial segments - as seen in the continued shift to electronic payments.\n\nPeople are looking for more opportunities to tap into the convenience and safety they associate with Mastercard While it may seem like you can use a card virtually everywhere, our work on acceptance is never finished. In the past six years, the number of merchants accepting Mastercard payments has more than doubled - to nearly 100 million locations. We are growing through Cloud Commerce, a cloud-native service that makes it easy for the smallest business to start accepting payments without an investment in new hardware.\n\nHowever, we also recognize there's not a one-size-fits-all approach. There are areas where a card payment may not be the best fit. That's why we are working to support the range of ways people and businesses want to pay and get paid.\n\nIt comes down to being simple, frictionless and secure in every instance. We're doing that in consumer card payments and by focusing on four additional flows - disbursements and remittances, commercial point of sale, business-to- business accounts payable and consumer bill payments. These areas are increasingly becoming a larger part of our business with more growth potential - an estimated $80 trillion in GDV.\n\nIn commercial, we're building on a strong foundation and expanding into small business, travel and entertainment, and fleet cards - similar to programs people use in their personal lives but with tailored benefits for their business.\n\nMastercard Send and our cross-border services expand our ability to deliver domestic and international payments securely to 90% of the world's population. There's also our industry-leading work with virtual cards, providing businesses with an effective solution to do more with their capital and their data."}

We switched (authorized, cleared and settled) 126 billion payment transactions last year. Each and every one was supported with the highest levels of security. In the last three years, Mastercard prevented $30 billion in potential customer fraud losses through Al-powered systems that we have built and evolved over the years. Our recent acquisition of Baffin Bay Networks adds to this by helping to identify and mitigate cyber threats our customers might face.\n\nEmbrace new networks We're extending into adjacent spaces and networks to leave no white space uncontested. Open banking and digital identity present new opportunities to extend the value of our brand, both as standalone offerings and in synergy with our core payments capabilities.\n\nJust look at the continued growth in open banking - the secure, permissioned access to financial data - and the demand for lending use cases, among others. Our technology is helping to power a Pay by Bank offering, an ACH payment directly from a bank account wherever Mastercard is accepted. It starts with the consumer saying how and where they want to securely share their account information. And it has the potential to take the pain out of - and add security into - recurring payments such as rent, utilities and healthcare.\n\nSimilarly, our identity services activities are using consent-driven insights to help banks, merchants and other businesses determine if their \"customer\" is a genuine user or if it's a fraudster. We are providing risk-based analysis, peace of mind and brilliant customer experiences across transactions and other digital interactions like new account openings.\n\n## Defining new technology and value\n\nWe have come a long way from the creation of the Mastercard network. We have made it easier for our customers to connect with Mastercard for whatever their needs might be. Today, our hybrid approach blends legacy and cloud technologies to enable more innovation, deliver greater reliability and do so in a regulatory-compliant and sustainable manner.\n\nThe emerging technologies we're creating and constantly innovating enable new partners and power new opportunities through the agility and scale enabled by the cloud, the speed and intelligence in quantum computing, and the potential of blockchain.\n\nIt's our responsibility to ensure that these technologies can come together and solve real problems. This future of payments requires an equal focus on privacy and security, including a responsible approach to activate Al. Without that foundational trust, people will not embrace new technologies, potentially weakening the digital economy's growth."}
