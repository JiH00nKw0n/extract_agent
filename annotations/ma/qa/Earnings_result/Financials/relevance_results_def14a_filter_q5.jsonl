They distinguish themselves even further if they have the resilience and ability to pivot when faced with disruptive forces. It is my view that Mastercard and its management team led by Michael, are demonstrating these characteristics and the results are evident.\n\nGreat companies devise\npowerful and purposeful\nstrategies and execute them\nwith excellent management\nteams. They distinguish\nthemselves even further if\nthey have the resilience and\nability to pivot when faced\nwith disruptive forces.\n\nLooking over the accomplishments of 2022, I am impressed by how this team has strategically and deliberately navigated the complexities they faced. Their priorities were clear: to ensure the strong continuity of the business, deliver on the needs of customers and partners, and take care of the people that bring the strategy to life. The management team delivered on today's commitments with steady growth in every quarter. As importantly, Mastercard continued to make strong progress on creating further long-term value, devising innovative technology, advancing financial inclusion, meeting environmental goals, and maintaining the responsible use of data.\n\nMastercard has an obligation to its stockholders, employees and customers, but we also play a critical role in the lives of SO many people across the globe: connecting buyers and sellers, enabling everyday commerce, helping to power data- driven decisions and having a positive social impact.\n\nI am also proud of the commitment of the Board of Directors. Our role as an independent Board is to provide oversight of the strategy, management and execution of these activities in a manner that ensures a continued high-level of performance and strong delivery of value to all stakeholders, including you, the company's stockholders. Our Board of Directors is a group of capable and diverse leaders with relevant experiences across many industries and geographies.\n\nThe Board's relationship with the Mastercard team has been one that emphasizes thoughtful debate, excellence, commonality of values, candor, and a strong commitment to work together to deliver on the objectives set for Mastercard's growth and success.\n\nFinally, I would also like to thank all of Mastercard's employees for their hard work throughout this year and our stockholders and customers for their continued support. We know that success is a shared journey, and we look forward to a strong year ahead. Despite many uncertainties, it is an exciting time.\n\nMichael and I look forward to sharing more with you at our upcoming annual meeting.\n\nMerit E. Janow\nBoard Chair\n\nJanew"}
