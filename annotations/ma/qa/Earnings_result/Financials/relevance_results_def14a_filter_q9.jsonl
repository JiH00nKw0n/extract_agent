The net charge is comprised of general and administrative expenses of $67 million, primarily related to incremental employee-related costs and reserves on uncollectible\n\nbalances with certain sanctioned customers. These charges are offset by net benefits of $37 million in net revenue, primarily related to a reduction in rebates and incentives liabilities as a result of lower estimates of customer performance for certain customer business agreements due to the suspension of our business operations in Russia.\n\n## Indirect tax matter\n\nDuring 2021, we recorded a charge of $88 million ($69 million after tax, or $0.07 per diluted share) to resolve a foreign indirect tax matter for 2015 through 2021 and the related interest.\n\nWe excluded these items because management evaluates the underlying operations and performance of the company separately from these recurring and nonrecurring items.\n\nWe believe that the non-GAAP financial measures presented facilitate an understanding of our operating performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods. We use non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate our ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes, and in the calculation of performance-based compensation."}
