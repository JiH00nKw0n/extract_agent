For RSUs granted in 2023, the awards generally vest ratably over three years.\n\nThe Company uses the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to determine the grant-date fair value of performance stock units (“PSUs”) granted. PSUs vest after three years from the date of grant and are subject to a mandatory one-year deferral period, during which vested PSUs are eligible for dividend equivalents.\n\nCompensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures over the shorter of the vesting period or the date the individual becomes eligible to retire under the LTIP. The Company uses the straight-line method of attribution over the requisite service period for expensing equity awards.\n\nNote 14. Income Taxes\n\nThe effective income tax rates were 15.0% and 18.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The lower effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023, versus the comparable period in 2022, was primarily due to the Company’s ability to now claim more U.S. foreign tax credits generated in 2022 and 2023 resulting from Notice 2023-55 (the “Notice”), released by the U.S. Department of Treasury (“Treasury”) in the current period, partially offset by a $115 million discrete tax expense to establish a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to U.S. foreign tax credits generated prior to 2022.\n\nThe effective income tax rates were 18.6% and 14.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The higher effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, versus the comparable period in 2022, was primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance associated with the deferred tax asset related to U.S. foreign tax credits. In 2022, the Company recognized a discrete tax benefit of $333 million to release the valuation allowance resulting from U.S. tax regulations published in the first quarter of 2022 (the “2022 Regulations”). In 2023, the treatment of foreign taxes paid under the 2022 Regulations changed due to the foreign tax legislation enacted in Brazil and the Notice released by Treasury. Therefore, the Company recognized a total $327 million discrete tax expense in 2023 to establish the valuation allowance. The discrete tax expense recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was partially offset by the Company’s ability to now claim more U.S. foreign tax credits generated in 2022 and 2023 due to the Notice.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the deferred tax asset related to U.S. foreign tax credits and corresponding valuation allowance is $575 million due to foreign tax legislation enacted in Brazil and the Notice. The valuation allowance relates to the Company’s ability to recognize future tax benefits associated with the carryforward of U.S. foreign tax credits generated in the current and prior periods. The recognition of the U.S. foreign tax credits is dependent upon the realization of future foreign source income in the appropriate foreign tax credit basket in accordance with U.S. federal income tax law.\n\nThe Company is subject to tax in the United States, Belgium, Singapore, the United Kingdom and various other foreign jurisdictions, as well as state and local jurisdictions. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted after considering facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitation. Within the next twelve months, the Company believes that the resolution of certain federal, foreign and state and local examinations is reasonably possible and that a change in estimate, reducing unrecognized tax benefits, may occur. While such a change may be significant, it is not possible to provide a range of the potential change until the examinations progress further or the related statutes of limitation expire. The Company has effectively settled its U.S. federal income tax obligations through 2014. With limited exception, the Company is no longer subject to state and local or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before 2011.\n\nNote 15. Legal and Regulatory Proceedings\n\nMastercard is a party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business. Some of these proceedings are based on complex claims involving substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as discussed below, it is not possible to determine the probability of loss or estimate damages, and therefore, Mastercard has not established reserves for any of these proceedings. When the Company determines that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, Mastercard records a liability and discloses the amount of the liability if it is material. When a material loss contingency is only reasonably possible, Mastercard does not record a liability, but instead discloses the nature and the amount of the claim, and an estimate of the loss or range of loss, if such an estimate can be made. Unless otherwise stated below with respect to these matters, Mastercard cannot provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss based on one or more of the following reasons: (1) actual or potential plaintiffs have not claimed an amount of monetary damages or the amounts are unsupportable or exaggerated, (2) the matters are in early stages, (3) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, (4) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, (5) the proceedings involve multiple defendants or potential defendants whose share of any potential financial responsibility has yet to be determined and/or (6) there are novel legal issues presented. Furthermore, except as identified with respect to the matters below, Mastercard does not believe that the outcome of any individual existing legal or regulatory proceeding to which it is a party will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition and overall business. However, an adverse judgment or other outcome or settlement with respect to any proceedings discussed below could result in fines or payments by Mastercard and/or could require Mastercard to change its business practices. In addition, an adverse outcome in a regulatory proceeding could lead to the filing of civil damage claims and possibly result in significant\n\n24  MASTERCARD SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 FORM 10-Q"}

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nOperators Complaint, although these complaints seek damages on behalf of consumers of ATM services who pay allegedly inflated ATM fees at both bank and non-bank ATM operators as a result of the defendants’ ATM rules. Plaintiffs seek both injunctive and monetary relief equal to treble the damages they claim to have sustained as a result of the alleged violations and their costs of suit, including attorneys’ fees.\n\nIn January 2012, the plaintiffs in the ATM Operators Complaint and the ATM Consumer Complaints filed amended class action complaints that largely mirror their prior complaints. In September 2019, the plaintiffs filed with the district court their motions for class certification in which the plaintiffs, in aggregate, allege over $1 billion in damages against all of the defendants. In August 2021, the trial court issued an order granting the plaintiffs’ request for class certification. In July 2023, the D.C. Circuit Court affirmed the district court order granting class certification, and subsequently denied Mastercard’s request for an appeal of that decision to all D.C. Circuit Court judges.\n\nEurope. Mastercard was named as a defendant in an action brought by Euronet 360 Finance Limited, Euronet Polska Spolka z.o.o. and Euronet Services spol. s.r.o. (“Euronet”) alleging that certain rules affecting ATM access fees in Poland, the Czech Republic and Greece by Visa and Mastercard, and certain of their subsidiaries, breach various competition laws. Euronet sought damages, costs and injunctive relief to prevent the defendants from enforcing these rules. The matter was resolved via a settlement in October 2023.\n\nU.S. Liability Shift Litigation\n\nIn March 2016, a proposed U.S. merchant class action complaint was filed in federal court in California alleging that Mastercard, Visa, American Express and Discover (the “Network Defendants”), EMVCo, and a number of issuing banks (the “Bank Defendants”) engaged in a conspiracy to shift fraud liability for card present transactions from issuing banks to merchants not yet in compliance with the standards for EMV chip cards in the United States (the “EMV Liability Shift”), in violation of the Sherman Act and California law. Plaintiffs allege damages equal to the value of all chargebacks for which class members became liable as a result of the EMV Liability Shift on October 1, 2015. The plaintiffs seek treble damages, attorney’s fees and costs and an injunction against future violations of governing law, and the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. In September 2016, the district court denied the Network Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint, but granted such a motion for EMVCo and the Bank Defendants. In May 2017, the district court transferred the case to New York so that discovery could be coordinated with the U.S. MDL Litigation Cases described above. In August 2020, the district court issued an order granting the plaintiffs’ request for class certification and in January 2021, the Network Defendants’ request for permission to appeal that decision was denied. The plaintiffs have submitted expert reports that allege aggregate damages in excess of $1 billion against the four Network Defendants. The Network Defendants have submitted expert reports rebutting both liability and damages. Briefing on summary judgment concluded.\n\nTelephone Consumer Protection Class Action\n\nMastercard is a defendant in a Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) class action pending in Florida. The plaintiffs are individuals and businesses who allege that approximately 381,000 unsolicited faxes were sent to them advertising a Mastercard co-brand card issued by First Arkansas Bank (“FAB”). The TCPA provides for uncapped statutory damages of $500 per fax. Mastercard has asserted various defenses to the claims, and has notified FAB of an indemnity claim that it has (which FAB has disputed). In December 2019, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) issued a declaratory ruling clarifying that the TCPA does not apply to faxes sent to online fax services that are received online via email. In December 2021, the trial court granted plaintiffs’ request for class certification, but narrowed the scope of the class to stand alone fax recipients only. Mastercard’s request to appeal that decision was denied. Briefing on plaintiffs’ motion to amend the class definition and Mastercard’s cross-motion to decertify the stand alone fax recipient class was completed in April 2023.\n\nU.S. Federal Trade Commission Investigation\n\nIn June 2020, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s Bureau of Competition (“FTC”) informed Mastercard that it initiated a formal investigation into compliance with the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. In particular, the investigation focused on Mastercard’s compliance with the debit routing provisions of the Durbin Amendment. In December 2022, the FTC voted to issue an administrative complaint and accept a consent agreement with Mastercard. Pursuant to this agreement, Mastercard agreed to provide primary account numbers (PANs) so that merchants can route tokenized online debit transactions to alternative networks. The consent agreement does not include any monetary penalty. Following a public comment period, the FTC finalized the consent agreement in May 2023.\n\nU.S. Department of Justice Investigation\n\nIn March 2023, Mastercard received a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) from the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division (“DOJ”) seeking documents and information regarding a potential violation of Sections 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act. The CID focuses on Mastercard’s U.S. debit program and competition with other payment networks and technologies. Mastercard is cooperating with the DOJ in connection with the CID.\n\nMASTERCARD SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 FORM 10-Q 27"}

Both the as reported and as adjusted effective income tax rates were lower versus the comparable period in 2022, primarily due to our ability to now claim more U.S. foreign tax credits generated in 2022 and 2023 resulting from Notice 2023-55 (the “Notice”), released by the U.S. Department of Treasury (“Treasury”) in the current period, partially offset by a $115 million discrete tax expense to establish a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to U.S. foreign tax credits generated prior to 2022.\n\nThe effective income tax rates were 18.6% and 14.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The adjusted effective income tax rates were 19.0% and 14.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Both the as reported and as adjusted effective income tax rates were higher versus the comparable period in 2022, primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance associated with the deferred tax asset related to U.S. foreign tax credits. In 2022, we recognized a discrete tax benefit of $333 million to release the valuation allowance resulting from U.S. tax regulations published in the first quarter of 2022 (the “2022 Regulations”). In 2023, the treatment of foreign taxes paid under the 2022 Regulations changed due to the foreign tax legislation enacted in Brazil and the Notice released by Treasury. Therefore, we recognized a total $327 million discrete tax expense in 2023 to establish the valuation allowance. The discrete tax expense recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was partially offset by our ability to now claim more U.S. foreign tax credits generated in 2022 and 2023 due to the Notice.\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the deferred tax asset related to U.S. foreign tax credits and corresponding valuation allowance is $575 million due to foreign tax legislation enacted in Brazil and the Notice. The valuation allowance relates to our ability to recognize future tax benefits associated with the carryforward of U.S. foreign tax credits generated in the current and prior periods. The recognition of the U.S. foreign tax credits is dependent upon the realization of future foreign source income in the appropriate foreign tax credit basket in accordance with U.S. federal income tax law.\n\nMASTERCARD SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 FORM 10-Q 45"}
