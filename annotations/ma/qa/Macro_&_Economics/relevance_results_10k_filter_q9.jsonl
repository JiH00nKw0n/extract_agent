Also, several industry initiatives are experimenting with the concept of account-based global schemes, which could lead to a disruption of the clearing and settlement options utilized in various currencies.\n\n•Digital Wallets and other Fintechs. As the global payments industry becomes more complex, we face increasing competition from fintechs and other emerging payments providers, both for customers and data. Many of these providers, who in many circumstances can also be our partners or customers, have developed payments systems focused on online activity in e-commerce and mobile channels (in some cases, expanding to other channels), and may process payments using in-house account transfers, real-time account-based payments networks or global or local networks, in addition to card. Examples include digital wallet providers, point-of-sale financing/buy-now-pay-later providers, mobile operator services, mobile phone-based money transfer and microfinancing services, handset manufacturers, B2B accounts payable and accounts receivable providers.\n\n•Government-Backed Networks. Governments have been increasingly creating and expanding local payments structures (such as the Brazilian Instant Payment System-PIX, FedNow in the U.S. and United Payments Interface (UPI) in India), which are increasingly being considered as alternatives to traditional domestic payment solutions and schemes such as ours. In particular, India has recently engaged in a series of efforts to expand the interoperability and cross-border reach of UPI globally. Most recently, it announced an agreement in 2023 to partner with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to enable Indian travelers within the UAE to pay with UPI. In addition to local and regional networks, national governments continue to explore the use of central bank digital currencies (“CBDCs”).\n\n•Digital Currencies. Stablecoins and floating cryptocurrencies may become more popular as they become more regulated and increasingly viewed as providing immediacy, 24/7 accessibility, immutability and efficiency. Some players, including payment service providers and payment facilitators, have started to enable merchant acceptance of such currencies in P2M, while some banks have started experimenting with blockchain B2B payments. Digital currencies and emerging players (such as crypto natives) have the ability to disrupt traditional financial markets. The increased prominence of digital currencies creates an opportunity for us but could equally compete with our products and services.\n\n•Value-Added Service Providers and New Network Capabilities Players. We face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our value-added services and solutions. These companies include information services and consulting firms that provide consulting services and insights to financial institutions, merchants and governments, technology companies that provide cyber and fraud solutions (including AI-based solutions), and companies that compete against us as providers of loyalty and program management solutions. We also face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our open banking and digital identity solutions. Regulatory initiatives could also lead to increased competition in this space.\n\n22 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K"}

Central banks and other regulators around the world either have, or are seeking to establish, formal oversight over participants in the payments industry, as well as authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in their countries. Such authority has resulted in regulation of Mastercard as financial market infrastructure, as well as regulation related to various aspects of our business (including areas such as consumer protections and cybersecurity). In the European Union (the “EU”), Mastercard is subject to systemic importance regulation, which includes various requirements we must meet, including obligations related to governance and risk management. In the U.K., the Bank of England designated VocalinkTM, our real-time account-based payments network platform, as a “specified service provider”, and Mastercard as a “recognized payment system”, which includes supervisions and examination requirements. In addition, EU legislation requires us to separate our scheme activities (brand, products, franchise and licensing) from our switching activities and other processing in terms of how we go to market, make decisions and organize our structure. Examples of other markets where Mastercard is formally overseen include Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico and South Africa. Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries are also regulated as payments institutions, including as money transmitters. This regulation subjects us to licensing obligations, regulatory supervision and examinations, as well as various business conduct and risk management requirements. Interchange Fees. Interchange fees that support the function and value of four-party payments systems like ours are being reviewed or challenged around the world via legislation to regulate interchange fees, competition-related regulatory proceedings, central bank regulation and litigation. Examples include statutes in the U.S. that cap debit interchange for certain regulated activities, proposed legislation in the U.S. to extend routing mandates to credit, our settlement with the European Commission (the “EC”) resolving its investigation into our interregional interchange fees and the EU legislation capping consumer credit and debit interchange fees on payments issued and acquired within the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). For more detail, see “Risk Factors - Other Regulation” in Part I, Item 1A and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.##Key 2023 Developments\n##•In October 2023, the U.S. Federal Reserve issued a proposal that would lower the interchange rate cap for debit and prepaid transactions in the U.S. by approximately 28%-30% (based on an average ticket size of $50), with the cap automatically updating every two years.\n##•In June 2023, legislation was re-introduced in the U.S. Senate that would extend routing mandates for Mastercard and Visa to credit. The bill stipulates that the top two networks could not be enabled on the same card, leaving room for regional networks to serve as second options. The bill proposes to mandate Mastercard provide authentication, tokenization or other security technology to competing networks, whether or not the transaction is switched by Mastercard.\n##•In October 2023, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposed a rule requiring data providers to make covered data available to consumers and authorized third parties, promoting industry standard-setting bodies recognized by the CFPB, and outlining obligations for third parties accessing data on behalf of consumers (including limitations on the collection, use and retention of covered data).\n##•In October 2023, Mastercard was designated by the Bank of Canada (BoC) as a “prominent payment system” as it relates to its business in Canada (i.e., a payment system that is critical for economic activity in Canada).

Similarly, jurisdictions that regulate a particular product may consider extending their jurisdiction to other products. For example, debit regulations could lead to regulation of credit products. Moreover, several jurisdictions are demonstrating increased interest about the network fees we charge to our customers (in some cases as part of broader market reviews of retail payments), which could in the future lead to regulation of our network fees. In several jurisdictions, we have been designated as a “systemically important payment system”, with other regulators considering similar designations. This type of regulation and oversight is related to switching activities (authorization, clearing and settlement), and includes policies, procedures and requirements related to risk management, collateral, participant default, timely switching of financial transactions, and capital and financial resources. Parts of our business have also been deemed as a “specified service provider” or considered “critical infrastructure”. The impact to our business created by any new law, regulation or designation is magnified by the potential it has to be replicated in, or conflict with, other jurisdictions, or involve other products within any particular jurisdiction.\n\nThe expansion of our products and services as part of our multi-rail strategy has also created the need for us to obtain new types and increasing numbers of regulatory licenses, resulting in increased supervision and additional compliance burdens distinct from those imposed on our core payment network activities. For example, certain of our subsidiaries maintain money transfer licenses to support certain activities. These licenses typically impose supervisory and examination requirements, as well as capital, safeguarding, risk management and other business obligations.\n\nIncreased regulation and oversight of payments systems, as well as increased exposure to regulation resulting from changes to our products and services, have resulted and may continue to result in significant compliance and governance burdens or otherwise increase our costs. As a result, customers could be less willing to participate in our payments system and/or use our other products or services, reduce the benefits offered in connection with the use of our products (making our products less desirable to consumers), reduce the volume of domestic and cross-border transactions or other operational metrics, disintermediate us, impact our profitability and/or limit our ability to innovate or offer differentiated products and services, all of which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance.

RISK FACTORS\n\nwe charge our customers could also materially and adversely impact our results of operations. Regulators could also require us to obtain prior approval for changes to our system rules, procedures or operations, or could require customization with regard to such changes, which could negatively impact us. Moreover, failure to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are subject could result in fines, sanctions, civil damages or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations, as well as have an impact on our brand and reputation.\n\nIncreased regulatory, legislative and litigation activity with respect to interchange rates could have an adverse impact on our business.\n\nInterchange rates are a significant component of the costs that merchants pay in connection with the acceptance of products associated with our core payment network. Although we do not earn revenues from interchange, interchange rates can impact the volume of transactions we see on our payment products. If interchange rates are too high, merchants may stop accepting our products or route transactions away from our network. If interchange rates are too low, issuers may stop promoting our products and services, eliminate or reduce loyalty rewards programs or other account holder benefits (e.g., free checking or low interest rates on balances), or charge fees to account holders (e.g., annual fees or late payment fees).\n\nGovernments and merchant groups in a number of countries have implemented or are seeking interchange rate reductions through legislation, regulation and litigation. See “Business - Government Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more details.\n\nIf issuers cannot collect or we are required to reduce interchange rates, issuers may be less willing to participate in our four-party payments system. Alternatively, they may reduce the benefits associated with our products, choose to charge higher fees to consumers to attempt to recoup a portion of the costs incurred for their services, or seek a fee reduction from us to decrease the expense of their payment programs (particularly if regulation has a disproportionate impact on us as compared to our competitors in terms of the fees we can charge). These and other impacts could make our products less desirable to consumers, limit our ability to innovate or offer differentiated products, and/or make proprietary three-party networks or other forms of payment more attractive, ultimately reducing the volume of transactions over our network and our profitability.\n\nWe are devoting substantial resources to defending our right to establish interchange rates in regulatory proceedings, litigation and legislative activity. The potential outcome of any of these activities could have a more positive or negative impact on us relative to our competitors. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our ability to establish interchange rates, any resulting legislation, regulation and/or litigation may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations. In addition, regulatory proceedings and litigation could result (and in some cases has resulted) in us being fined and/or having to pay civil damages, the amount of which could be material.\n\nLimitations on our ability to restrict merchant surcharging could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.\n\nWe have historically implemented policies, referred to as no-surcharge rules, in certain jurisdictions, including the U.S. and Canada, that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using our products instead of other means. Authorities in several jurisdictions have acted to end or limit the application of these no-surcharge rules (or indicated interest in doing so). Additionally, our no-surcharge rules now permit U.S. and Canadian merchants to surcharge credit cards (subject to certain limitations), which over time could lead merchants in some or all merchant categories in these jurisdictions to choose to surcharge as permitted. This could result in consumers viewing our products less favorably and/or using alternative means of payment instead of electronic products, which could result in a decrease in our overall transaction volumes, and which in turn could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.\n\nPreferential or Protective Government Actions\n\nPreferential and protective government actions related to domestic payment services could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues.\n\nGovernments in some countries have acted, or in the future may act, to provide resources, preferential treatment or other protection to selected national payment and switching providers, or have created, or may in the future create, their own national provider. This action may displace us from, prevent us from entering into, or substantially restrict us from participating in, particular geographies, and may prevent us from competing effectively against those providers. For example:\n\n•Governments in some countries have implemented, or may implement, regulatory requirements that mandate switching of domestic payments either entirely in that country or by only domestic companies.\n\n•Some jurisdictions have implemented, or are considering, requirements to collect, store and/or process data within their borders, as well as prohibitions on the transfer of data abroad, leading to technological and operational implications as well as increased compliance burdens and other costs.\n\n28 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K"}

Our inability to effect change in, or work with, these jurisdictions could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenues and extend our global brand.\n\nAdditionally, some jurisdictions have implemented, or may implement, foreign ownership restrictions, which could potentially have the effect of forcing or inducing the transfer of our technology and proprietary information as a condition of access to their markets. Such restrictions could adversely impact our ability to compete in these markets.\n\nPrivacy, Data Protection, AI and Information Security\n\nRegulation and enforcement of privacy, data, AI, information security and the digital economy could increase our costs and lead to legal claims and fines, as well as negatively impact our growth and reputation.\n\nWe are subject to increasingly complex, fragmented and divergent laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection, data use and governance, AI and information security in the jurisdictions in which we do business. While policymakers around the globe look to the EU and the GDPR when adopting new or updated privacy and data protection laws, divergences have occurred and continue to occur. As a result, new or updated privacy and data protection and information security laws and regulations have led, and may continue to lead, to similar, stricter or at times conflicting requirements, creating an uncertain regulatory environment. For example, some jurisdictions have implemented or are otherwise considering requirements to collect, store and/or process data within their borders, as well as prohibitions on the transfer of data abroad, leading to technological and operational implications. Other jurisdictions have adopted or are otherwise considering adopting sector-specific regulations for the payments industry and other industries in which we participate, including forced data sharing requirements or additional verification requirements. In addition, laws and regulations on AI, data governance and credit decisioning may overlap or conflict with, or diverge from, general privacy rules. Overall, these myriad laws and regulations may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies, incur substantial compliance-related costs and expenses, and otherwise suffer adverse impacts on our business. Failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations and requirements could result in fines, sanctions or other enforcement actions or penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business, as well as have an impact on our reputation.\n\nAs a user and deployer of AI technology, we are also subject to increasing and evolving laws and regulations related to AI governance and new applications of existing laws and regulations to AI. How our use and deployment of AI will be regulated remains uncertain given the uncertainty that exists as to how AI technology will develop. In addition, the use of AI creates or amplifies risks that are challenging to fully prevent or mitigate. In particular, AI algorithms may generate inaccurate, unintended, unfair or discriminatory outcomes, which may not be easily detectable or explainable, and may inadvertently breach intellectual property, privacy or other rights, as well as confidential information. Our implementation of robust AI governance and risk management frameworks aimed at complying with emerging laws and regulations may not be sufficient protection against these emerging risks.\n\nFurther, as we acquire new companies and develop integrated and personalized products and services to meet the needs of a changing marketplace, we have expanded our data profile through additional data types and sources, across multiple channels, and involving new partners. This expansion has amplified the impact of these various laws and regulations on our business. As a result, we are required to constantly monitor our data practices and potentially change them when necessary or appropriate. We also need to provide increased care in our data management, governance and quality practices, particularly as it relates to the use of data in products leveraging AI.\n\nNew requirements or changing interpretations of existing requirements in these areas, or the development of new regulatory schemes related to the digital economy in general, may also increase our costs and/or restrict our ability to leverage data or use AI for innovation. This could impact the products and services we offer and other aspects of our business, such as fraud monitoring, the need for improved data management, governance and quality practices, the development of information-based products and solutions, and technology operations. In addition, these requirements may increase the costs to our customers of issuing payment\n\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 29"}

RISK FACTORS\n\nRoadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments)). These factors could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\n\nRapid and significant technological developments and changes could negatively impact our overall business and results of operations or limit our future growth.\n\nThe payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes, which can impact our business in several ways:\n\n•Technological changes (including continuing developments of technologies in the areas of smart cards and devices, contactless and mobile payments, e-commerce, cryptocurrency and blockchain, AI, machine learning, privacy enhancement and cybersecurity) could result in new technologies that may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our programs and services. Moreover, these changes could result in new and innovative payment methods, products and services that could place us at a competitive disadvantage and that could reduce the use of our products and services.\n\n•We rely in part on third parties (including some of our competitors and potential competitors) for the development of and access to new technologies. The inability of these companies to keep pace with technological developments, or the acquisition of these companies by competitors, could negatively impact our offerings.\n\n•Our ability to develop and adopt new services and technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide solutions and standards (such as those related to EMV, tokenization or other safety and security technologies), and by resistance from customers or merchants to such changes.\n\n•Our ability to develop evolving systems and products may be inhibited by any difficulty we may experience in attracting and retaining employees with technology expertise.\n\n•Our ability to adopt these technologies can also be inhibited by intellectual property rights of third parties. We have received, and we may in the future receive, notices or inquiries from patent holders (including operating companies or non-practicing entities) suggesting that we may be infringing patents or that we need to license the use of their patents to avoid infringement. Such notices may, among other things, threaten litigation against us or our customers or demand significant license fees.\n\n•Our ability to develop new technologies and reflect technological changes in our payments offerings requires resources, which has resulted in and may further result in additional expenses.\n\n•We work with fintechs, technology companies (such as digital players and mobile providers) and traditional customers that use our technology to enhance payment safety and security and to deliver their payment-related products and services quickly and efficiently to consumers. Our inability to keep pace technologically could negatively impact the willingness of these customers to work with us, and could encourage them to use their own technology and compete against us.\n\n•Regulatory or government requirements have and could continue to require us to host and deliver certain products and services on-soil in certain markets, requiring us to alter our technology and delivery model, potentially resulting in additional expenses.\n\n•Various central banks are experimenting with CBDCs which may be launched with their own networks to transfer money between participants. Policy and design considerations that governments adopt could impact the extent of our role in facilitating CBDC-based payment transactions, potentially impacting the transactions that we may process over our network.\n\nWe cannot predict the effect of future technological changes on our business, and our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate, develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards. Failure to keep pace with these technological developments or otherwise bring to market products that reflect these technologies could lead to a decline in the use of our products, which could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\n\nOperating a real-time account-based payments network presents risks that could materially affect our business.\n\nU.K. regulators have designated Vocalink, our real-time account-based payments network platform, to be a “specified service provider” and regulators in other countries may in the future expand their regulatory oversight of real-time account-based payments systems in similar ways. In addition, any prolonged service outage on this network could result in quickly escalating impacts, including potential intervention by the Bank of England and significant reputational risk to Vocalink and us. For a discussion of the regulatory risks related to our real-time account-based payments platform and oversight by regulators, see our risk factor in “Risk Factors - Payments Industry Regulation” in this Part I, Item 1A. Furthermore, the complexity of this payment technology requires careful management to address information security vulnerabilities that are different from those faced on our core payment network. Operational difficulties, such as the temporary unavailability of our services or products, or information security breaches on our real-time account-based payments network could cause a loss of business for these products and services, result in potential liability for us and adversely affect our reputation.\n\n\n\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 33"}

RISK FACTORS\n\nStakeholder Relationships\n\nLosing a significant portion of business from one or more of our largest customers could lead to significant revenue decreases in the longer term, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our results of operations.\n\nMany of our customer relationships are not exclusive. Our customers can reassess their future commitments to us subject to the terms of our contracts, and they separately may develop their own services that compete with ours. Our business agreements with these customers may not ultimately reduce the risk inherent in our business that customers may terminate their relationships with us in favor of relationships with our competitors, or for other reasons, or might not meet their contractual obligations to us.\n\nIn addition, a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers. Loss of business from any of our large customers could have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\n\nExclusive/near exclusive relationships certain customers have with our competitors may have a material adverse impact on our business.\n\nWhile we have exclusive, or nearly-exclusive, relationships with certain of our customers to issue payment products, other customers have similar exclusive, or nearly-exclusive, relationships with our competitors. These relationships may make it difficult or cost-prohibitive for us to do significant amounts of business with these customers to increase our revenues. In addition, these customers may be more successful and may grow faster than the customers that primarily issue our payment products, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, we earn substantial revenue from customers with nearly-exclusive relationships with our competitors. Such relationships could provide advantages to the customers to shift business from us to the competitors with which they are principally aligned. A significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business.\n\nConsolidation amongst our customers could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operations.\n\nOur customers’ industries have undergone substantial, accelerated consolidation in the past. These consolidations have included customers with a substantial Mastercard portfolio being acquired by institutions with a strong relationship with a competitor. Potential future consolidation could occur as a result of bank failures, similar to those that occurred in the U.S. during 2023. If significant consolidation among customers were to continue, it could result in the substantial loss of business for us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and prospects. In addition, one or more of our customers could seek to merge with, or acquire, one of our competitors, and any such transaction could also have a material adverse impact on our overall business. Consolidation could also produce a smaller number of large customers, which could increase their bargaining power and lead to lower prices and/or more favorable terms for our customers. These developments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nOur business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and, in many jurisdictions, their ability to effectively manage or help manage our brands.\n\nWhile we work directly with many stakeholders in the payments system (including merchants, governments, fintechs and large digital companies and other technology companies), we are, and will continue to be, significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers and acquirers and their respective relationships with account holders and merchants to support our programs and services. Furthermore, we depend on our issuing partners and acquirers to continue to innovate to maintain competitiveness in the market. We do not issue cards or other payment devices, extend credit to account holders or determine the interest rates or other fees charged to account holders. Each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program features. In addition, we do not establish the discount rate that merchants are charged for acceptance, which is the responsibility of our acquiring customers. As a result, our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customers and the strength of our relationships with them. In turn, our customers’ success depends on a variety of factors over which we have little or no influence, including economic conditions in global financial markets or their disintermediation by competitors or emerging technologies, as well as regulation. If our customers become financially unstable, we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk. See “Risk Factors - Settlement and Third-Party Obligations” in this Part I, Item 1A with respect to how we guarantee certain third-party obligations.\n\nWith the exception of the U.S. and a select number of other jurisdictions, most in-country (as opposed to cross-border) transactions conducted using cards with our brands are switched by our customers or other processors. Because we do not provide domestic switching services in these countries or have direct relationships with account holders, we depend on our close working relationships with our customers to effectively manage our brands, and the perception of our payments system, among consumers in these countries. We also rely on these customers to help manage our brands and perception among regulators and merchants in these countries, alongside our own relationships with them. From time to time, our customers may take actions that we do not believe to be in the best interests of our payments system overall, which may materially and adversely impact our business.\n\n36 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K"}

RISK FACTORS\n\nMerchants’ continued focus on acceptance costs may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and increase our incentive program costs, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability.\n\nMerchants are important constituents in our payments system. We rely on both our relationships with them, as well as their relationships with our issuer and acquirer customers, to continue to expand the acceptance of our products and services. We also work with merchants to help them enable new sales channels, create better purchase experiences, improve efficiencies, increase revenues and fight fraud. In the retail industry, we believe a set of larger merchants with increasingly global scope and influence are having a significant impact on all participants in the global payments industry, including Mastercard. Some large merchants have supported the legal, regulatory and legislative challenges to interchange fees that Mastercard has been defending, including the U.S. merchant litigations. Some merchants are increasingly asking regulators to review and potentially regulate our own network fees, in addition to interchange. See “Risk Factors – Payments Industry Regulation” in this Part I, Item 1A. The continued focus of merchants on the costs of accepting various forms of payment (including digital) may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings.\n\nCertain larger merchants are also able to negotiate incentives from us and pricing concessions from our issuer and acquirer customers as a condition to accepting our products. We also make payments to certain merchants to incentivize them to create co-branded payment programs with us. As merchants consolidate and become even larger, we may have to increase the amount of incentives that we provide to certain merchants, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Competitive and regulatory pressures on pricing could make it difficult to offset the costs of these incentives. Additionally, if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows, our business could suffer.\n\nOur work with governments exposes us to unique risks that could have a material impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nAs we increase our work with national, state and local governments, both indirectly through financial institutions and with them directly as our customers, we may face various risks inherent in associating or contracting directly with governments. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n•Governmental entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. Changes in governmental priorities or other political developments, including disruptions in governmental operations, could impact approved funding and result in changes in the scope, or lead to the termination, of the arrangements or contracts we or financial institutions enter into with respect to our payment products and services.\n\n•Our work with governments is heavily regulated, subjecting us to additional potential exposure under U.S. and international anti-corruption laws (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act), as well as compliance with various procurement and other laws, regulations, standards and contract terms. Any violation and subsequent judgment or settlement related to the above could subject us to substantial monetary penalties and damages and have a significant reputational impact. Moreover, as a government contractor, we are subject to a government’s right to conduct audits and investigations into both our contract performance and our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and contract terms. Any adverse finding could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, sanctions, or suspension or disbarment.\n\n•Working or contracting with governments, either directly or via our financial institution customers, can subject us to heightened reputational risks, including extensive scrutiny and publicity, as well as a potential association with the policies of a government as a result of a business arrangement with that government. Any negative publicity or negative association with a government entity, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation.\n\nGlobal Economic and Political Environment\n\nGlobal economic, political, financial and societal events or conditions could result in a material and adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations.\n\nAdverse economic trends. Adverse economic trends in key countries in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance. Such impact may include, but is not limited to, the following:\n\n•Customers mitigating their economic exposure by limiting the issuance of new Mastercard products and requesting greater incentive or greater cost stability from us\n\n•Consumers and businesses lowering spending, which could impact domestic and cross-border spend\n\n•Debt limit and budgetary discussions in the U.S. has affected, and could further affect, the U.S. credit rating, impacting consumer confidence and spending\n\n•Government intervention (including the effect of laws, regulations and/or government investments on or in our financial institution customers), as well as uncertainty due to changing political regimes in executive, legislative and/or judicial branches of government, that may have potential negative effects on our business and our relationships with customers or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our products\n\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 37"}
