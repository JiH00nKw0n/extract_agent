These assessments are primarily driven by the domestic dollar volume of activity (e.g., domestic purchase volume, domestic cash volume) or the number of cards issued.\n\n•Cross-border assessments are charges based on activity related to cards that carry the Company’s brands where the merchant country and the country of issuance are different. These assessments are primarily driven by the cross-border dollar volume of activity (e.g., cross-border purchase volume, cross-border cash volume).\n\n38  MASTERCARD SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 FORM 10-Q"}
