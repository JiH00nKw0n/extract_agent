Good morning, everyone. Here's the headline. We closed out 2023 with another quarter of strong earnings and revenue growth. Quarter 4 net revenues were up 11% and operating income up 13%, both versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, as always. These results were driven by healthy consumer spending and the ongoing execution of our strategy. Our deal momentum continued this quarter, powered by a broad range of unique, diversified products and services, both designed to solve our customers' needs. \n\nLet's start on the macroeconomic front, where we see both tailwinds and headwinds. First, the labor market remains strong with low unemployment and rising wages. These remain key drivers of consumer spending. Some risks we are monitoring include credit availability and delinquency rates. Second, while inflation continues to moderate, prices of many goods and services remain elevated. We're tracking the efforts of central banks who are actively managing interest rates to normalize inflation. And finally, geopolitical uncertainty remains a concern in several markets. On balance, we remain fairly positive about the growth outlook, but we are monitoring the environment closely, and we'll manage the business accordingly.  \n\nLooking at our switch trends this quarter. Domestic volume growth remains healthy. And cross-border spending remains strong, up 18% globally in the fourth quarter on a local currency basis. With that as a backdrop, we remain focused on our strategic priorities, which fuel our growth algorithm across payments, and services and new networks. In payments, our growth algorithm consists of 5 key areas: one, being in the flow to capture the natural growth of economies.  Two, accelerating the secular shift to electronic payments across both spend and transactions; three, further penetrating the addressable market in new flows and four, growing market share; and five, optimizing our customer portfolios for performance. Economies are growing, and that's not in our control. However, we are executing on the rest.  \n\nBuilding on that, the run rate for the secular shift is substantial. We are accelerating it by scaling acceptance, enhancing the user experience for digital transactions and driving adoption in new sectors and new use cases. In 2023, we added millions of new acceptance locations worldwide. This growth has been aided by scaling our tap on phone and cloud commerce capabilities. We are now live in over 18 markets. Smaller merchants can start accepting payments by simply downloading an app. And larger merchants are leveraging the technology to promote quick and seamless checkout experiences anywhere in store.  \n\nWith supporting partners like Apple, who in 2023, expanded tap to pay on iPhone into Australia, the U.K., France, Brazil and several other markets. We're also accelerating the secular shift away from both from cash and closed loop transactions such as transit through our contactless capabilities. Contactless provides a fast, secure and seamless consumer experience in areas like transit, creates an opportunity to capture incremental transactions with a tap for every single ride. And when consumers use contactless for transit, they often extend that behavior across other low dollar spend categories.  \n\nWe've made great progress with many major cities such as London and New York, operating broad-based open-loop systems. However, there is still significant runway for us, given that only a small percentage of large cities globally are operating open-loop systems at scale. And we're leaning into advanced payment technologies like Click to Pay, tokenization and biometrics. They offer embedded, secure and password-free checkout solutions and with that, bring in elevated level of security, simplicity and speed to every transaction. And that's true regardless of the device, browser or card. These solutions not only benefit consumers, but they also create value for merchants as their customers are less likely to abandon a transaction and issuers also benefit from an increase in customer stickiness.  \n\nFor Click to Pay, we are now live in over 35 countries, supported by over 50 channel partners. And in 2023, we drove over 60% growth in transactions. Klarna will implement Click to Pay this year and activate their merchants across all European markets where they operate. We're driving tokenization across all channels, including devices, commerce platforms, card on file and guest checkout. Tokenization reduces fraud and increases approval rates by approximately 3 to 6 percentage points across regions. And we're expanding our biometric payment capabilities, which enable payments with a smile or a wave.  \n\nAfter launching in Brazil, we have now partnered with NEC Corporation to bring our biometric checkout to the Asia Pacific region. We're also driving growth by winning and retaining deals across consumer payments, account-to-account and new flows. This week, we shared that BOK Financial will flip its U.S. debit portfolio to Mastercard making us the exclusive partner across its debit and commercial portfolios. They selected us due to our differentiated virtual card and open banking assets, fraud solutions and our shared commitment to financial inclusion. This marks the third U.S. regulated debit flip we signed in the last year, building on our recent successes with Citizens and Webster Bank, both of which have now started converting their portfolios. And BPER Banca, one of the largest banks in Italy will migrate their debit card to Mastercard as well.  \n\nWe renewed our partnership with Commonwealth Bank of Australia, we will retain exclusivity across their consumer credit and debit portfolios. We signed a long-term partnership with Shinhan Card, the largest issuer in Korea to solidify our leadership in the country. This relationship spans consumer and commercial card offerings and expand into new services, including data analytics. And in Canada, we executed an exclusive long-term renewal of the President's Choice Financial, consumer credit and prepaid portfolios.  \n\nWe're also winning in fintechs, co-brands and public sector partners. When it comes to fintechs, MasterCard is a partner of choice. In fact, Mastercard serves over 80% of the top digital payment in Neobank fintechs on the CNBC Global Fintech list. With the support of Starling Bank, one of the largest fintechs in the U.K. renewed their partnership with MasterCard.  \n\nIn the co-brand space, we're partnering with J.Crew and Synchrony in the U.S. to launch the retailer's first co-branded digital first card. And in the public sector, we have an exclusive partnership with Fiserv Money Network for all U.S. state and federal government benefit and wage disbursement debit programs. As part of our partnership, we are thrilled to launch with the California Economic Development Department in February, the largest unemployment program in the United States.  \n\nAs you can see, we continue our positive deal momentum powered by our differentiated products and services are always keeping a focus on financial discipline. This also helps us to capture more of the secular tailwind and in turn, further drive services growth.  \n\nLooking to China. We are thrilled that our joint venture in China has received formal approval to commence domestic bank card clearing. Believe that we will be uniquely positioned to provide Chinese consumers with an exceptional payment experience using a single card that's optimized for both domestic and cross-border spend. While we're excited about the medium- to long-term opportunity, there's still work to be done as we fully build out the issuing and acceptance footprint. As we do that, we continue to grow our presence with bank and fintech partners in the market. ICBC launched the first World MasterCard product in November, and Bank of Communications selected Mastercard to launch their first international debit card.  \n\nBeyond cards, we also continue to make meaningful progress in the account-to-account space. This quarter, we announced a long-term strategic partnership with the Clearing House, the operator of the RTP network, which continues to secure our position in real-time payments in the United States.  \n\nNow shifting gears. We continue to execute against our strategy to capture the large secular opportunity in targeted new flows, including commercial payments and disbursements and remittances. We continue to win in commercial. This spans commercial point of sale and B2B accounts payable, which we target through our market-leading virtual card solution. This quarter alone, we renewed our commercial relationships with JPMorgan and FLEETCOR 2 of the largest commercial issuers in the United States. BNP Paribas Fortis will flip their business credit portfolio to Mastercard in Belgium. And on the virtual card front, we announced 2 exciting partnerships in the online travel agency space with Booking.com and Agoda.  \n\nTurning now to disbursements and remittances. In 2023, we grew transactions by over 30%. We continue to scale our use cases. For example, UBS has integrated our cross-border services capability. This will enable them to execute instant cross-border payments from multiple use cases, including helping their customers pay employees abroad. In addition, we also partnered with Alipay to establish them as a cross-border payments receiving institution in China. \n\nPayments, services and new networks reinforce each other. We said it countless times, our services and new networks provide differentiation, as noted in many of the wins I mentioned. Underlying payments growth helps drive services too. And payments growth brings incremental rich data. Our services turn that data into valuable insights and when implemented by our customers, those insights can drive incremental digitization of payments. In turn, this generates even more data, more transaction and more need for fraud tools and the powerful cycle continues. The services and new networks components of our growth algorithms are built on, driving increased penetration of existing customers, extending our services across new customers and customer types, and continuing to build and deploy new services.  \n\nHere are a few examples how we are executing against each of these. The past year, Bank of America has expanded their services relationship with us to include test and learn program management and supplier enablement solutions. This on top of many of our services they already have. Axis Bank in India has also expanded their relationship with us. They will use our consulting, marketing and analytics services to support end-to-end portfolio life cycle management. Worldpay is utilizing our fraud alerts to streamline the dispute resolution process. And Citi has deployed consumer clarity, digital receipts to provide eligible U.S. cardholders with detailed purchase information directly through their bank app. Now with increased visibility about the merchant and purchase details, consumers can easily validate transactions and reduce the number of disputes they file.  \n\nSquare is also integrating consumer clarity solution. Furthermore, Nexi has chosen Mastercard as a strategic partner to roll out Open Banking for e-commerce payments across Europe and the list goes on. We're extending our services and solutions across new customer types, including large marketplaces. Alibaba will use Mastercard's open banking technology to help streamline the onboarding experience for small businesses on the U.S. marketplace and reduce fraud. And Meta utilizes our digital identity technology to improve authentication for online orders. We also continue to develop new services and solutions, many of which leverage the work we are doing with generative AI.\n\nGenerative AI brings more opportunity to drive better experiences for our customers, makes it easier to extract insights from our data. It can also help us increase internal productivity. We are working on many Gen AI use cases today to do just that. For example, we recently announced shopping news, shopping news users generative AI to offer a conversational shopping tool that recreates the in-store human experience online, can translate consumers collegially language into tailored recommendations. Another example is Mastercard Small Business AI. The tool will draw on our existing small business resources, along with the content from a newly formed global media coalition to help business owners navigate a range of business challenges. The platform, which is scheduled for pilot launch later this year will leverage AI to provide personalized real-time assistance delivered in a conversational tone.  \n\nAnd finally, we expanded Mastercard access, which provides customers with a single point of connectivity to quickly and easily source our AI, digital and identity services. Using access, customers can deploy these services across multiple rails or networks, including those outside the MasterCard network. This is an exciting development, which enhances our ability to scale our services across networks and streamlines the ability for our customers to adopt our capabilities.  \n\nSo with that, I will wrap it up. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter and year of revenue and earnings growth. We're successfully executing against our strategy and on our growth algorithm, our differentiated capabilities, diversified business model and focused strategy position us well to capitalize on the significant opportunity in front of us. Sachin, over to you."}

Turning now to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the fourth quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding where applicable, special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. Net revenue was up 11%, reflecting continued growth in our payment network and our value-added services and solutions. Operating expenses increased 9%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. And operating income was up 13%, including a minimal impact from acquisitions. Net income and EPS increased by 15% and 18%, respectively, both reflecting the strong operating income growth as well as a nonrecurring tax benefit recognized in the fourth quarter. EPS was $3.18, which includes an $0.08 contribution from share repurchases.  \n\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased $1.8 billion worth of stock and an additional $586 million through January 26, 2024.  \n\nSo let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV increased by 10% year-over-year on a local currency basis. In the U.S., GDV increased by 4% with credit growth of 5% and debit growth of 3%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 13% with credit growth of 13% and debit growth of 12%. Sequentially, the debit growth rate was primarily impacted by the lapping of the NatWest portfolio migration in the U.K. Overall, cross-border volume increased 18% globally for the quarter on a local currency basis, reflecting continued strong growth in both travel and non-travel related cross-border spending.  \n\nWhile this is sequentially lower versus Q3, this is primarily due to tougher comps as we continue to lap the cross-border travel recovery from last year.  \n\nTurning to Page 5. Switched transactions grew 12% year-over-year in Q4, both card-present and card-not-present growth rates remain strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration as contactless now represents approximately 65% of all in-person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 8%. Globally, there are 3.3 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued.  \n\nTurning to Slide 6 for a look into our net revenues for the fourth quarter discussed on a currency-neutral basis. Payment Network net revenue increased 7%, primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth and also includes growth in rebates and incentives. Value-added Services & Solutions net revenue increased 17%, primarily driven by strong growth in our Cyber & Intelligence Solutions, driven by the growth in our underlying drivers and the continued scaling of our fraud and security solutions and our identity and authentication solutions. In addition, we saw strong growth in our marketing, data analytics and consulting services as well as our loyalty solutions. This was partially tempered by slower relative growth in our other solutions.  \n\nNow let's turn to Page 7 to discuss key metrics related to the payment network, again, described on a currency-neutral basis unless otherwise noted. Looking quickly at each metric. Domestic assessments were up 7%, while worldwide GDV grew 10%. The difference is primarily driven by mix. Cross-border assessments increased 21%, while cross-border volumes increased 18%. The 3 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix. Transaction processing assessments were up 10%, while switched transactions grew 12%. The 2 ppt difference is primarily due to lower revenues related to FX volatility versus the prior year. Other network assessments were $251 million this quarter. As a reminder, these assessments primarily relate to licensing, implementation and other franchise fees and may fluctuate from period to period.  \n\nMoving on to Page 8. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 9%, which includes a minimal impact from acquisitions. This increase was primarily due to increased spending on personnel to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives and increased spending on marketing campaigns, advertising and sponsorships like the UEFA Champions League and the Rugby World Cup.  \n\nTurning to Page 9, you will see that we are no longer providing operating metrics as a percentage of 2019 given that we are well past the pandemic. Now let me comment on the operating metric trends in the fourth quarter and through the first 4 weeks of January. Starting with switched volume growth year-over-year. The sequential decline from Q3 to Q4 is primarily due to the lapping effects from the routing of all MasterCard branded volume in Japan to the Mastercard switch and the migration of the NatWest portfolio to Mastercard. Specific to the U.S., the sequential decline from Q3 to Q4 was primarily due to tougher comps.  \n\nMoving to the first 4 weeks of January, switched volume growth in the U.S. was impacted primarily by severe weather events across the country. As we look specifically at the fourth week of January, which did not have the same impact from severe weather, switched volume in the U.S. returned to approximately 5% growth year-over-year, similar to what we saw in December. Outside of the U.S., we continue to lap the migration of the NatWest portfolio. Switch transactions follow similar patterns to switched volumes. Looking at cross-border for both Q4 and the first 4 weeks of January, cross-border travel growth continues to be primarily impacted by tougher comps as we lap the recovery of travel. Cross-border card not present ex travel continues to show strength.  \n\nTurning now to Page 10. I wanted to share our thoughts on fiscal year 2024. Let me start by saying our business fundamentals remain strong. We continue to grow through a combination of healthy consumer spending, new and renewed customer agreements, continued secular shift from cash to card and strong growth across our service offerings. In short, as Michael said, we are executing on our strategy and realizing the benefits from our growth algorithm. Overall, we remain fairly positive about the growth outlook. Consumer spending continues to be supported by a strong labor market and wage growth. Our base case scenario for 2024 reflects healthy consumer spending and recent spending dynamics. That being said, we are closely monitoring both positives and negatives in the macro environment as well as geopolitical events and we stand ready to manage our investment levels as appropriate, while maintaining focus on our key strategic priorities.  \n\nAs it relates to the full year 2024, our base case is for net revenues to grow at the high end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions and foreign exchange are forecasted to have a minimal impact for the year. In terms of operating expenses, we expect full year growth at the low end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Of note, this includes an increase of approximately 1 ppt in operating expense due to a new Brazil tax legislation, which went into effect as of January 1, 2024. This legislation results in higher operating expenses due to an increase in indirect taxes, which is more than offset by a reduction in our income taxes expense.   \n\nAcquisitions and foreign exchange are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate for the year.  \n\nNow turning to Q1 2024. Year-over-year net revenue growth is expected to be at the low end of a low double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions. Acquisitions and foreign exchange are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate for the quarter. \n\nLet me briefly talk through why our full year currency-neutral net revenue growth is expected to be higher than the first quarter of 2024. This is primarily driven by 2 factors: first, revenues related to FX volatility were highest in Q1 2023 compared to the other quarters in the year. And second, while our value-added services and solutions continue to grow at a healthy pace. From a cadence perspective, we expect Q1 growth to be lower relative to the other quarters, primarily due to tougher comps. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q1 operating expense growth to be at the high end of a high single-digit rate versus a year ago, again, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Once again, this includes an increase of approximately 1 ppt related to the Brazil tax legislation that I mentioned earlier. \n\nAcquisitions are forecasted to add 0 to 1 ppt to this OpEx growth and foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of approximately 0 to 1 ppt for the quarter. Other items to keep in mind. On the other income and expense line, we expect an expense of approximately $60 million to $65 million for Q1, given the prevailing interest rates and debt levels. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. Finally, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 16% to 17% for Q1 and approximately 17% on a full year basis, all based on the current geographic mix of our business. This reflects the benefit to our effective tax rate related to the Brazil tax legislation that I mentioned earlier.  \n\nAnd with that, I will turn the call back over to Devin."}

Let me take both of those questions. First, on Reg II, let me just kind of share with everybody that from a Reg II standpoint, we haven't seen any material impact come through as far as what we've seen so far on the data. Obviously we will keep a close eye on it as the year progresses, but nothing to actually report from any sort of material impact. On your question around U.S. card volume growth, look at the end of the day, here's the way we think about it, right? We continue to believe that in the U.S., there remains a decent amount of secular opportunity, both from a volume standpoint and from a transaction growth standpoint. In addition to that, as you know, business models are evolving, spending behaviors are changing, and that creates greater opportunity from a volume and a transaction standpoint. But more specifically, what I'd tell you is the following, which is in the release of the U.S.\n\nWe've got to kind of think about what's going on with PCE and what the impact of inflation is in the PCE numbers relative to where it's taking place, i.e., is it taking place in carded volumes? Or is it taking in place in noncarded categories of spend. So as you do the analysis, at least as we do the analysis, the way we think about this is we look at PCE, we think about on a normalized basis, if inflation were to take place fairly evenly across both carded and non-carded PCE, it gives us a high degree of comfort that there's a decent amount of secular opportunity, which still remains in the U.S. from a growth standpoint.  \n\nNow in addition to the secular opportunity and the fact that the U.S. continues to actually perform well from an overall consumer health standpoint, we're very active. We're growing our volumes by winning share. I mean you've heard about this quarter-over-quarter in terms of what we're doing to win volumes from new customers. We've had good wins on the debit space, which, as you know, is a challenged kind of environment in the U.S. So overall, I tell you from the U.S. standpoint, it continues to be a very important market, one which is going to be a decent contributor to our growth driven by the PCE growth component, the secular shift as well as share. And again, what I'm talking about is on the card payment volume side of the business."}

{"category": "Macro & Economics", "question": "How does Mastercard view the strength of U.S. consumer demand entering 2025?", "file_type": "Earnings", "index": 59, "result_lines": ["We talked about China earlier on, where we're investing heavily in acceptance footprint.", "So I would say it's leaning a little more on the international side, but here in the U.S., we're very busy going for use cases and verticals."], "translated_lines": ["우리는 앞서 중국에 대해 이야기했는데, 그곳에서 우리는 수용 범위에 대대적으로 투자하고 있습니다.", "그래서 저는 약간 국제적인 쪽에 더 기울어져 있다고 말하고 싶습니다만, 여기 미국에서는 우리는 사용 사례와 수직 시장을 공략하는 데 매우 바쁩니다."], "chunk": "Right. So starting with Finicity and then we have the corresponding set of capabilities through our IA acquisition in Europe. We're also building out connectivity in Australia. Those are the 3 regions where we're focused. And open banking does a number of things. Essentially, what we see is a set of use cases here that rise to the top and everything that you could do with open banking. In the end, there's this big vision about OpenData, where people can use their data footprint. Small businesses can use the data footprint for getting access to better services. But for now, what's really rising at the top is account opening, the example that I already gave. \n\nOpen Banking for payments, I come to that for a moment -- in a moment, open banking for lending and for small business in particular. So those are kind of the 3 categories that we feel are particularly relevant right now for payments, it's really interesting, to your point, is this a volume driver? It could because the connectivity that we have here, what we're trying to do is facilitate payments, for example, in non-carded use cases as we have the pay by bank solution in the United States in partnership with Chase bank. So we hope to see significant volume growth out of that. That's the whole idea. And that builds on our experience with  Pay-by-Bank in the U.K. This is a somewhat different approach here in the U.S. where our open banking capabilities are the true differentiators. So use cases that matter. That's the focus. And out of that, we hope to see not only API clicks on account opening, but also payment volume coming through.  \n\nSorry. That was a second part of the question. My team is just reminding me. Acceptance growth regionally. I mean it comes to the answer actually that Sachin gave earlier where we talked a little bit about payments growth and the regional comparison. So when you think beyond the United States, we see a tremendous growth opportunity. Here in the United States, you would say it's more new use cases and verticals, and it's more generally and broader acceptance across the payments landscape in the rest of the world. There's even significant geographic opportunities to grow. Take Japan, for example. So it's a country that is what the government has put out a stated policy to drive a cashless Japan. So tremendous upside there. We talked about China earlier on, where we're investing heavily in acceptance footprint. So I would say it's leaning a little more on the international side, but here in the U.S., we're very busy going for use cases and verticals."}
{"category": "Macro & Economics", "question": "How does Mastercard view the strength of U.S. consumer demand entering 2025?", "file_type": "Earnings", "index": 87, "result_lines": ["We've kind of shared with you what our base case is.", "And the base case continues to assume that the consumer spending remains healthy, and we're reflecting in the current spending dynamics.", "From an overall kind of volumes and transaction standpoint."], "translated_lines": ["우리는 기본 사례가 무엇인지 여러분과 어느 정도 공유했습니다.", "기본 가정은 소비자 지출이 계속해서 건강한 상태를 유지한다는 것이며, 우리는 현재의 지출 동향에 이를 반영하고 있습니다.", "전체적인 거래량과 거래 관점에서 보면."], "chunk": "So look, I'm not going to give you a specific kind of forecast as it relates to what we're assuming from a driver standpoint. We've kind of shared with you what our base case is. And the base case continues to assume that the consumer spending remains healthy, and we're reflecting in the current spending dynamics. From an overall kind of volumes and transaction standpoint. I think to your question on pricing, it's no different than it's been in the past. We always price based on the value we deliver to our customers. And we will continue to do that wherever it makes sense across the globe. And we kind of have new things which we're launching, there's new value we're delivering to our customers. And as we do that, we'll continue to price for that.\n\nOn specifically the Contra question. I think the -- the important thing to note on Contra is that at the end of the day, Contra is enabling volume growth, right? We pay incentives and rebates to our customers to bring more volume onto our network. And as we do that, we're paying for that. For the first quarter, we expect our Contra as a percentage of our payment network assessments to be roughly similar to what you saw in Q4 of 2023. I would tell you, on a full year basis, it's going to be entirely a function of how we see deals play out, what the pipeline is. Obviously, we know what the outlook is from a pipeline standpoint. Some of that will come to fruition. Some of that will not. There'll be other things, which will move in and out. And so I'm not going to kind of share with you what the full year outlook is on Contra, but for Q1, I can kind of give you my thoughts, which are we expect that Contra as a percentage of payment network assessments will be roughly similar to what we saw in Q4 of 2023."}
