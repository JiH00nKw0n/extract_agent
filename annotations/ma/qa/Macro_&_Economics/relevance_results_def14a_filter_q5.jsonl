In early 2023, we're seeing the continued challenges of higher inflation and shocks to the banking industry.\n\nYet, I remain a pragmatic optimist. That's because I have seen just how resilient people can be, how quickly they can recover and the positive impact they can have.

It is the core of what we deliver in expanded relationships with partners and customers including Citizens Bank, Santander and NatWest. This consumer card business continues to be healthy. There's plenty of runway ahead - in both the consumer and commercial segments - as seen in the continued shift to electronic payments.\n\nPeople are looking for more opportunities to tap into the convenience and safety they associate with Mastercard While it may seem like you can use a card virtually everywhere, our work on acceptance is never finished. In the past six years, the number of merchants accepting Mastercard payments has more than doubled - to nearly 100 million locations. We are growing through Cloud Commerce, a cloud-native service that makes it easy for the smallest business to start accepting payments without an investment in new hardware.\n\nHowever, we also recognize there's not a one-size-fits-all approach. There are areas where a card payment may not be the best fit. That's why we are working to support the range of ways people and businesses want to pay and get paid.\n\nIt comes down to being simple, frictionless and secure in every instance. We're doing that in consumer card payments and by focusing on four additional flows - disbursements and remittances, commercial point of sale, business-to- business accounts payable and consumer bill payments. These areas are increasingly becoming a larger part of our business with more growth potential - an estimated $80 trillion in GDV.\n\nIn commercial, we're building on a strong foundation and expanding into small business, travel and entertainment, and fleet cards - similar to programs people use in their personal lives but with tailored benefits for their business.\n\nMastercard Send and our cross-border services expand our ability to deliver domestic and international payments securely to 90% of the world's population. There's also our industry-leading work with virtual cards, providing businesses with an effective solution to do more with their capital and their data."}

As an organization, we place great emphasis on how we work together, deliver impact and, with that, ensure our resiliency.\n\nCulture can be a competitive advantage, and it is strongest when teams feel a powerful connection to each other and have shared goals and a clear path to grow and win. Today, the Mastercard Way focuses on three areas -- creating value, growing together and moving fast, all with a foundation of doing the right thing.\n\nOur 29,900 colleagues across the globe have diverse backgrounds and experiences, but they all are mission-driven, talented and passionate people. Whether they are engineers or programmers, product managers, consultants or finance specialists, they all are pulling toward a shared goal and common purpose.\n\n## Ensuring a sustainable social impact\n\nWe have the fundamental belief that businesses cannot thrive in an unhealthy and unequal world. That's why our significant commitment to sustainable economies and social impact is necessary. Addressing our environmental impacts and enabling financial inclusion are smart for our business and are the right thing to do for society. They give people full access to their money. They bring a farmer's crops to a wider digital marketplace. They help with greater connectivity and allow more people to participate in today's economy, no matter where they are.\n\nThat strengthens the resilience of our communities, grows prosperity and delivers long-term value creation with new customers. We are only one part of a much larger story, but I am proud of the role that we play with our partners across the public and private sectors.\n\n## Delivering on the vision, executing on our strategy\n\nYes, there are many external challenges, but there are also clear opportunities. I believe in our long-term growth potential because of our differentiated strategy, people, production and solutions.\n\nEarlier, I talked about our momentum coming into this year. We are using that to our advantage - to reinforce our value to our customers, to deliver on our commitments and to imagine new ways to apply our skills, creativity and experience.\n\nOur ambition is to power\neconomies and empower\npeople. Our activities and\nprograms enable a stronger\necosystem that helps US all be\nmore resilient to whatever lies\nahead.\n\nIt's what we have continually committed to. It's what we have consistently delivered on. That track record is what makes Mastercard valuable and integral to our partners. Our ambition is to power economies and empower people. Our activities and programs enable a stronger ecosystem that helps US all be more resilient to whatever lies ahead.\n\nThat is why I'm optimistic about our future.\n\nThank you for your continued support.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nMichael Miebach\nPresident and CEO\n\n7"}

They distinguish themselves even further if they have the resilience and ability to pivot when faced with disruptive forces. It is my view that Mastercard and its management team led by Michael, are demonstrating these characteristics and the results are evident.\n\nGreat companies devise\npowerful and purposeful\nstrategies and execute them\nwith excellent management\nteams. They distinguish\nthemselves even further if\nthey have the resilience and\nability to pivot when faced\nwith disruptive forces.\n\nLooking over the accomplishments of 2022, I am impressed by how this team has strategically and deliberately navigated the complexities they faced. Their priorities were clear: to ensure the strong continuity of the business, deliver on the needs of customers and partners, and take care of the people that bring the strategy to life. The management team delivered on today's commitments with steady growth in every quarter. As importantly, Mastercard continued to make strong progress on creating further long-term value, devising innovative technology, advancing financial inclusion, meeting environmental goals, and maintaining the responsible use of data.\n\nMastercard has an obligation to its stockholders, employees and customers, but we also play a critical role in the lives of SO many people across the globe: connecting buyers and sellers, enabling everyday commerce, helping to power data- driven decisions and having a positive social impact.\n\nI am also proud of the commitment of the Board of Directors. Our role as an independent Board is to provide oversight of the strategy, management and execution of these activities in a manner that ensures a continued high-level of performance and strong delivery of value to all stakeholders, including you, the company's stockholders. Our Board of Directors is a group of capable and diverse leaders with relevant experiences across many industries and geographies.\n\nThe Board's relationship with the Mastercard team has been one that emphasizes thoughtful debate, excellence, commonality of values, candor, and a strong commitment to work together to deliver on the objectives set for Mastercard's growth and success.\n\nFinally, I would also like to thank all of Mastercard's employees for their hard work throughout this year and our stockholders and customers for their continued support. We know that success is a shared journey, and we look forward to a strong year ahead. Despite many uncertainties, it is an exciting time.\n\nMichael and I look forward to sharing more with you at our upcoming annual meeting.\n\nMerit E. Janow\nBoard Chair\n\nJanew"}
