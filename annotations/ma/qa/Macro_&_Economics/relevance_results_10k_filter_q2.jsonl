Our VCN solution may include the use of Mastercard InControlTM, our virtual card platform that allows buyers to pay suppliers using a one-time use card number that can be set with transaction level controls, providing unmatched configurability and flexibility.   Additionally, we offer a platform to optimize supplier payment enablement campaigns for financial institutions, as well as our treasury intelligence platform that provides corporations with recommendations to improve working capital performance and accelerate spend on cards. Key 2023 Developments\n •In 2023, we launched Mastercard Receivables Manager, a solution aimed at streamlining how suppliers receive virtual card payments by automating the integration of reconciliation data into suppliers’ accounts receivables systems.   •In 2023, our Disbursements and Remittances capabilities have the ability to reach more than 95% of the world’s banked population.\nDisbursements and Remittances.
