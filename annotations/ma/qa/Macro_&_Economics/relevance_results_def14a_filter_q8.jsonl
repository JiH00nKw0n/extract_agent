Performance targets for our 2020 PSUs were set prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which created significant headwinds for our business, resulting in a below-target payout for 2020 PSUs.\n\nThe following table shows the performance assessment against the adjusted net revenue and adjusted EPS metrics:\n\n<table><tr><th>Measurement</th><th>Threshold 1</th><th>Target 1</th><th>Maximum 1</th><th>Actual</th><th>Score</th></tr><tr><td>Three-year adjusted net revenue CAGR2</td><td>11.2%</td><td>15.2%</td><td>20.2%</td><td>11,1%</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Three-year adjusted EPS CAGR³</td><td>14.2%</td><td>19.2%</td><td>23.2%</td><td>14.6%</td><td>54.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Average of net revenue and EPS score (pre-TSR score)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>27.0%</td></tr></table>\n\n1 PCE was 120 bps (basis points) above the forecast, and, as such, original adjusted net revenue and adjusted EPS minimum, target and maximum were each automatically adjusted upward by 120 bps accordingly. 2 Results shown differ from net revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) under GAAP because they exclude the impact of 2020-2022 acquisitions, translational and transactional impacts of foreign currency, and the related impact of our foreign exchange derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments. 3 Results shown differ from EPS CAGR under GAAP because they exclude 2020-2022 acquisitions, translational and transactional impacts of foreign currency, the related impact of our foreign exchange derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments, gain/loss on equity investments, litigation provisions, changes to U.S. tax legislation, and certain discrete tax and other one-time items. The actual impact on EPS from share buybacks versus the initial assumed impact did not result in any change to the final PSU score.\n\nThe\n\nfollowing table shows the relative TSR performance assessment, which provides for up to a +/- 50 percentage point adjustment, and the\nwhich could range from 0%-200% of target:\n\nfinal\n\nPSU\n\npayout\n\nscore,\n\n<table><tr><th>Measurement</th><th>Threshold\n(50% modifier)</th><th>Target\n(100% modifier)</th><th>Maximum\n(150% modifier)</th><th>Actual\nresult</th><th>Pre-TSR score\n(a)</th><th>Modifier\n(b)</th></tr><tr><td>Three-year relative TSR\nmodifier</td><td>25th percentile\n(TSR of -2.07%)</td><td>50th percentile\n(TSR of 23.66%)</td><td>75th percentile\n(TSR of 51.19%)</td><td>36th percentile\n(TSR of 8.95%)</td><td>27.0%</td><td>71.0%</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\">Payout rate (axb)</td><td colspan=\"2\">19.2%</td></tr></table>\n\n78"}
