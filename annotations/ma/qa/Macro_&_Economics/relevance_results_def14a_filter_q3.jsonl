In early 2023, we're seeing the continued challenges of higher inflation and shocks to the banking industry.\n\nYet, I remain a pragmatic optimist. That's because I have seen just how resilient people can be, how quickly they can recover and the positive impact they can have. The payments industry has and will continue to play an important role in these efforts."}
