We focus on expanding upon our core payments network to enable payment flows for consumers, businesses, governments and others, which provides them with choice and flexibility to transact across multiple payment rails (including cards, real-time payments, account-based transactions, crypto and others), while ensuring that all payments are safe, secure and seamless. We do so by:\n\n•Driving growth in consumer payments with a focus on accelerating digitization, growing acceptance and pursuing an expanded set of use cases, including through partnerships\n\n•Capturing new payment flows by expanding our multi-rail capabilities and applications to penetrate key flows such as commercial point-of-sale transactions, business-to-business (“B2B”) accounts payable flows, disbursements and remittances and consumer bill payments\n\n•Leaning into new payment innovations including acceptance growth accelerators such as Tap on Phone, cloud commerce and contactless, as well as developing solutions that support digital currencies and blockchain applications\n\nExtend our services. Our services drive value for our customers and the broader payments ecosystem. These services include cyber and intelligence solutions, insights and analytics, consulting, marketing, loyalty, processing and payment gateway solutions for e-commerce merchants. As we drive value, our services generate revenue while helping to accelerate our overall financial performance by supporting revenue growth in payments and new network opportunities. We extend our services by:\n\n•Enhancing the value of payments by making payments safe, secure, intelligent and seamless\n\n•Expanding services to new segments and use cases to address the needs of a larger set of customers, including financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital players and others, while expanding our geographic reach\n\n•Supporting and strengthening new network capabilities, including expanding services associated with digital identities and deploying our expertise in open banking and open data\n\nEmbrace new network opportunities. We are building and managing new adjacent network capabilities to power commerce and payments, creating new opportunities to develop and embed services. We do so by:\n\n•Applying our open banking solutions to help institutions and individuals exchange consumer-permissioned data securely and easily by enabling the reliable access, transmission and management of consumer data (including for opening new accounts, securing loans, increasing credit scores and enabling consumer choice in money movement and personal finance management)\n\n•Enabling digital identity solutions to instill trust in the digital world and help ensure that payments across consumers, businesses, devices and virtual entities are efficient, safe and secure\n\nEach of our priorities supports and builds upon each other and are fundamentally interdependent:\n\n•Payments provide data and distribution to drive scale and differentiation in services and enable the development and adoption of new network capabilities\n\n•Services improve the security, efficiency and intelligence of payments, improve portfolio performance, differentiate our offerings, strengthen our customer relationships and support our open banking and digital identity networks\n\n•New network opportunities strengthen our digital payments value proposition, including improved authentication with digital identity, and new opportunities to develop and embed services in our expanding product offerings\n\nPowering Our Success\n\nThese priorities are supported by six key drivers:\n\nPeople. Our success is driven by the skills, experience, integrity and mindset of our people. We attract, develop and retain top talent from diverse backgrounds and industries, in alignment with our strategic priorities. Our winning culture is guided by the Mastercard Way, which outlines the behaviors we expect from employees to deliver for our customers and one another.

BUSINESS\n\nRevenue Sources\n\nMastercard is a payments network service provider that generates revenue from a wide range of payment solutions we provide to our customers. We classify our net revenues, which includes the impact of rebates and incentives, from contracts with customers into two categories: (i) payment network and (ii) value-added services and solutions.\n\nWithin our payment network, revenue is primarily generated from charging fees to our customers based on GDV (which includes both domestic and cross-border volume) on the cards that carry our brands and for providing switching and other network-related services.\n\nWithin our value-added services and solutions, we generate revenue primarily related to the following:\n\n•Cyber and intelligence solutions •Data and services solutions •ACH batch and real-time account-based domestic and cross-border payments and solutions •Processing and gateway •Open banking solutions •Digital identity solutions\n\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Revenue” in Part II, Item 7 and Note 3, Revenue for more detail about our revenue.\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nWe own a number of valuable trademarks that are essential to our business, including Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus, through one or more affiliates. We also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands, programs and services offered by us to support our payment programs. Trademark and service mark registrations are generally valid indefinitely as long as they are used and/or properly maintained. Through license agreements with our customers, we authorize the use of our trademarks on a royalty-free basis in connection with our customers’ issuing and merchant acquiring businesses. In addition, we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payment solutions, transaction processing, smart cards, contactless, mobile, biometrics, AI, security systems, blockchain and other technologies, which are important to our business operations. These patents expire at varying times depending on the jurisdiction and filing date.\n\nCompetition\n\nWe face a number of competitors both within and outside of the global payments industry. We compete in all categories of payments (including paper-based payments and all forms of electronic payments) as well as in all categories in which we provide value-added services and solutions:\n\n•General Purpose Payments Networks. We compete worldwide with payments networks such as Visa, American Express, JCB, China UnionPay and Discover, among others. These competitors tend to offer a range of card-based payment products. Some competitors have more market share than we do in certain jurisdictions. Some also have different business models that may provide an advantage in pricing, regulatory compliance burdens or otherwise. Globally, financial institutions may issue both Mastercard- and Visa-branded payment products, and we compete with Visa for business on the basis of individual portfolios or programs. In addition, a number of our customers issue American Express-, China UnionPay- and/or Discover-branded payment cards in a manner consistent with a four-party system. We continue to face intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our issuers and acquirers, and we seek to enter into business agreements with them through which we offer incentives and other support to issue and promote our payment products.\n\n•Debit and Local Networks. We compete with ATM and point-of-sale debit networks. In various countries, local debit brands serve as the main domestic brands, while our brands are used mostly to enable cross-border transactions (typically representing a small portion of overall transaction volume). In addition, several governments are promoting, or considering promoting, local networks for domestic switching. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A for a more detailed discussion of the risks related to payments system regulation and government actions that may prevent us from competing effectively.\n\n•Real-time Account-based Payments Systems. We face competition in the ACH and real-time account-based payments space from providers of infrastructure, applications and services. As these real-time account-based propositions mature, we face a possible increase in competition for our existing domestic person-to-merchant (“P2M”) and person-to-person (“P2P”) transaction market share. Similarly, as interlinking of these infrastructures is further explored, they could disrupt our existing cross-border\n\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 21"}

Also, several industry initiatives are experimenting with the concept of account-based global schemes, which could lead to a disruption of the clearing and settlement options utilized in various currencies.\n\n•Digital Wallets and other Fintechs. As the global payments industry becomes more complex, we face increasing competition from fintechs and other emerging payments providers, both for customers and data. Many of these providers, who in many circumstances can also be our partners or customers, have developed payments systems focused on online activity in e-commerce and mobile channels (in some cases, expanding to other channels), and may process payments using in-house account transfers, real-time account-based payments networks or global or local networks, in addition to card. Examples include digital wallet providers, point-of-sale financing/buy-now-pay-later providers, mobile operator services, mobile phone-based money transfer and microfinancing services, handset manufacturers, B2B accounts payable and accounts receivable providers.\n\n•Government-Backed Networks. Governments have been increasingly creating and expanding local payments structures (such as the Brazilian Instant Payment System-PIX, FedNow in the U.S. and United Payments Interface (UPI) in India), which are increasingly being considered as alternatives to traditional domestic payment solutions and schemes such as ours. In particular, India has recently engaged in a series of efforts to expand the interoperability and cross-border reach of UPI globally. Most recently, it announced an agreement in 2023 to partner with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to enable Indian travelers within the UAE to pay with UPI. In addition to local and regional networks, national governments continue to explore the use of central bank digital currencies (“CBDCs”).\n\n•Digital Currencies. Stablecoins and floating cryptocurrencies may become more popular as they become more regulated and increasingly viewed as providing immediacy, 24/7 accessibility, immutability and efficiency. Some players, including payment service providers and payment facilitators, have started to enable merchant acceptance of such currencies in P2M, while some banks have started experimenting with blockchain B2B payments. Digital currencies and emerging players (such as crypto natives) have the ability to disrupt traditional financial markets. The increased prominence of digital currencies creates an opportunity for us but could equally compete with our products and services.\n\n•Value-Added Service Providers and New Network Capabilities Players. We face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our value-added services and solutions. These companies include information services and consulting firms that provide consulting services and insights to financial institutions, merchants and governments, technology companies that provide cyber and fraud solutions (including AI-based solutions), and companies that compete against us as providers of loyalty and program management solutions. We also face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our open banking and digital identity solutions. Regulatory initiatives could also lead to increased competition in this space.\n\n22 MASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K"}

We are subject to anti-money laundering (“AML”) and countering the financing of terrorism (“CFT”) laws and regulations globally, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act, as well as the various economic sanctions programs, including those imposed and administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). We have implemented a comprehensive AML/CFT program, comprised of policies, procedures and internal controls, including the designation of a compliance officer, which is designed to prevent our payments network from being used to facilitate money laundering and other illicit activity and to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks. The economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC restrict financial transactions and other dealings with certain countries and geographies (specifically Crimea, the Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic regions of Ukraine, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria) and with persons and entities included in OFAC sanctions lists including its list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (the “SDN List”). We take measures to prevent transactions that do not comply with OFAC and other applicable sanctions, including establishing a risk-based compliance program that has policies, procedures and controls designed to prevent us from having unlawful business dealings with prohibited countries, regions, individuals or entities. As part of this program, we obligate issuers and acquirers to comply with their local sanctions obligations and U.S. and EU sanctions programs. In the U.S., these obligations include requiring the screening of account holders and merchants, respectively, against OFAC sanctions lists (including the SDN List). Iran and Syria have been identified by the U.S. State Department as terrorist-sponsoring states, and we have no offices, subsidiaries or affiliated entities located in these countries and do not license entities domiciled there. We are also subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations globally, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, which, among other things, generally prohibit giving or offering payments or anything of value for the purpose of improperly influencing a business decision or to gain an unfair business advantage. We have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls to proactively manage corruption risk.\n\nIssuer and Acquirer Practices Legislation and Regulation.  Our issuers and acquirers are subject to numerous regulations and investigations applicable to banks, financial institutions and other licensed entities, impacting us as a consequence. Additionally, regulations such as the revised Payment Services Directive (commonly referred to as “PSD2”) in the EEA require financial institutions to provide third-party payment processors access to consumer payment accounts, enabling them to route transactions away from Mastercard products and provide payment initiation and account information services directly to consumers who use our products. PSD2 also requires a new standard for authentication of transactions, which necessitates additional verification information from consumers to complete transactions. This may increase the number of transactions that consumers abandon if we are unable to ensure a frictionless authentication experience under the new standards.\n\nRegulation of Internet, Digital Transactions and High-Risk Merchant Categories. Various jurisdictions have enacted or have proposed regulation related to internet transactions which applies to payments system participants, including us and our customers. We may also be impacted by evolving laws surrounding gambling, including fantasy sports, as well as certain legally permissible but high-risk merchant categories, such as adult content, firearms, alcohol and tobacco.\n\nPrivacy, Data Protection, AI and Information Security.  Aspects of our operations or business are subject to increasingly complex and fragmented privacy, data and information security laws and regulations in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere around the world. For example, in the U.S., we and our customers are respectively subject to, among other laws and regulations, Federal Trade Commission and federal banking agency information safeguarding requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) that require, among other things, the maintenance of a written, comprehensive information security program and, increasingly, a number of state data and privacy laws. With respect to information security, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) adopted new disclosure rules that require, among other things, disclosing material cybersecurity incidents in a Current Report on Form 8-K, generally within four business days of determining an incident is material. In the EU, we are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) and its equivalent in the U.K., which requires, among other things, a comprehensive privacy, data protection and information security program to protect the personal and sensitive data of EEA residents. Several regulators and policymakers around the globe use the GDPR as a reference to adopt new or updated privacy, data protection and information security laws and regulations, although divergences have occurred. Laws and regulations in this area are constantly evolving due to several factors, including increasing data collection and data flows, numerous data breaches and security incidents, more sensitive data categories, and emerging technologies such as AI. In addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy, data protection and information security laws and regulations are often uncertain and in a state of flux, thus requiring constant monitoring for compliance.\n\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 25"}

Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of Mastercard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Mastercard International Incorporated (“Mastercard International”) (together, “Mastercard” or the “Company”), included elsewhere in this Report. Percentage changes provided throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” were calculated on amounts rounded to the nearest thousand. For discussion related to the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, please see Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nBusiness Overview\n\nMastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry. We connect consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide by enabling electronic payments and making those payment transactions safe, simple, smart, and accessible. We make payments easier and more efficient by providing a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known and trusted brands, including Mastercard®, Maestro® and Cirrus®. We operate a multi-rail payments network that provides choice and flexibility for consumers, merchants and our customers. Through our unique and proprietary core global payments network, we switch (authorize, clear and settle) payment transactions. We have additional payments capabilities that include automated clearing house (“ACH”) transactions (both batch and real-time account-based payments). Using these capabilities, we offer payment products and services and capture new payment flows. Our value-added services include, among others, cyber and intelligence solutions designed to allow all parties to transact securely, easily and with confidence, as well as other services that provide proprietary insights, drawing on our principled and responsible use of secure consumer and merchant data. Our investments in new networks, such as open banking solutions and digital identity capabilities, support and strengthen our payments and services solutions. Each of our capabilities support and build upon each other and are fundamentally interdependent. For our core global payments network, our franchise model sets the standards and ground-rules that balance value and risk across all stakeholders and allows for interoperability among them. We employ a multi-layered approach to help protect the global payments ecosystem in which we operate.\n\nMastercard is not a financial institution. We do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants’ acceptance of our products. In most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our customers.\n\nFinancial Results Overview\n\nThe following table provides a summary of our key GAAP operating results, as reported:"}

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n\nNote 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nOrganization\n\nMastercard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Mastercard International Incorporated (“Mastercard International” and together with Mastercard Incorporated, “Mastercard” or the “Company”), is a technology company in the global payments industry. Mastercard connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide by enabling electronic forms of payment and making those payment transactions safe, simple, smart and accessible.

The Company employs a multi-layered approach to help protect the global payments ecosystem in which it operates.\n\nMastercard is not a financial institution. The Company does not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants’ acceptance of the Company’s products. In most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, the Company’s financial institution customers.\n\nSignificant Accounting Policies\n\nConsolidation and basis of presentation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Mastercard and its majority-owned and controlled entities, including any variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Investments in VIEs for which the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary are not consolidated and are accounted for as marketable, equity method or measurement alternative method investments and recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no significant VIEs which required consolidation and the investments were not considered material to the consolidated financial statements. The Company consolidates acquisitions as of the date on which the Company has obtained a controlling financial interest. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2023 presentation. The reclassifications had no impact on previously reported total net revenue, operating income or net income. The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity interest not owned by the Company and are recorded for consolidated entities in which the Company owns less than 100% of the interests. Changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest are accounted for as equity transactions, and upon loss of control, retained ownership interests are remeasured at fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. For 2023, 2022 and 2021, net income/(losses) attributable to non-controlling interests were not material and, as a result, amounts are included on the consolidated statement of operations within other income (expense).\n\nUse of estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty; accordingly, accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment. These financial statements were prepared using information reasonably available as of December 31, 2023 and through the date of this Report. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Company’s operating environment changes. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nMASTERCARD 2023 FORM 10-K 74"}
