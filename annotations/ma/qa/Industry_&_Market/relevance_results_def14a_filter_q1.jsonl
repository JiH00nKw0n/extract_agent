The graph starts near $0 in 2006 and shows a steady increase over time, with a sharp rise beginning around 2016. The stock price reaches a peak of around $400 before slightly declining to end at approximately $350 by the end of 2022.\n\nMastercard's historically strong performance has resulted in the substantial appreciation of our stock price from a split-adjusted per share price of $3.90 at the time of our initial public offering in May 2006 to a closing stock price of $347.73 per share as of December 31, 2022.\n\nAs discussed in this CD&A, in considering program design and individual pay decisions in 2022, the HRCC carefully considered this performance, as well as the interests of all stakeholders, including our stockholders."}
