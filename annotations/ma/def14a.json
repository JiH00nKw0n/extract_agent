It is the core of what we deliver in expanded relationships with partners and customers including Citizens Bank, Santander and NatWest. This consumer card business continues to be healthy. There's plenty of runway ahead - in both the consumer and commercial segments - as seen in the continued shift to electronic payments.\n\nPeople are looking for more opportunities to tap into the convenience and safety they associate with Mastercard While it may seem like you can use a card virtually everywhere, our work on acceptance is never finished. In the past six years, the number of merchants accepting Mastercard payments has more than doubled - to nearly 100 million locations. We are growing through Cloud Commerce, a cloud-native service that makes it easy for the smallest business to start accepting payments without an investment in new hardware.\n\nHowever, we also recognize there's not a one-size-fits-all approach. There are areas where a card payment may not be the best fit. That's why we are working to support the range of ways people and businesses want to pay and get paid.\n\nIt comes down to being simple, frictionless and secure in every instance. We're doing that in consumer card payments and by focusing on four additional flows - disbursements and remittances, commercial point of sale, business-to- business accounts payable and consumer bill payments. These areas are increasingly becoming a larger part of our business with more growth potential - an estimated $80 trillion in GDV.\n\nIn commercial, we're building on a strong foundation and expanding into small business, travel and entertainment, and fleet cards - similar to programs people use in their personal lives but with tailored benefits for their business.\n\nMastercard Send and our cross-border services expand our ability to deliver domestic and international payments securely to 90% of the world's population.

They distinguish themselves even further if they have the resilience and ability to pivot when faced with disruptive forces. It is my view that Mastercard and its management team led by Michael, are demonstrating these characteristics and the results are evident.\n\nGreat companies devise\npowerful and purposeful\nstrategies and execute them\nwith excellent management\nteams. They distinguish\nthemselves even further if\nthey have the resilience and\nability to pivot when faced\nwith disruptive forces.\n\nLooking over the accomplishments of 2022, I am impressed by how this team has strategically and deliberately navigated the complexities they faced. Their priorities were clear: to ensure the strong continuity of the business, deliver on the needs of customers and partners, and take care of the people that bring the strategy to life. The management team delivered on today's commitments with steady growth in every quarter. As importantly, Mastercard continued to make strong progress on creating further long-term value, devising innovative technology, advancing financial inclusion, meeting environmental goals, and maintaining the responsible use of data.\n\nMastercard has an obligation to its stockholders, employees and customers, but we also play a critical role in the lives of SO many people across the globe: connecting buyers and sellers, enabling everyday commerce, helping to power data- driven decisions and having a positive social impact.\n\nI am also proud of the commitment of the Board of Directors. Our role as an independent Board is to provide oversight of the strategy, management and execution of these activities in a manner that ensures a continued high-level of performance and strong delivery of value to all stakeholders, including you, the company's stockholders. Our Board of Directors is a group of capable and diverse leaders with relevant experiences across many industries and geographies.\n\nThe Board's relationship with the Mastercard team has been one that emphasizes thoughtful debate, excellence, commonality of values, candor, and a strong commitment to work together to deliver on the objectives set for Mastercard's growth and success.\n\nFinally, I would also like to thank all of Mastercard's employees for their hard work throughout this year and our stockholders and customers for their continued support. We know that success is a shared journey, and we look forward to a strong year ahead.

We focus on expanding upon our core payments network to enable payment flows for consumers, businesses, governments and others, as well as providing them with choice and flexibility to transact across multiple payment rails (including cards, real-time payments, account- to-account transactions, crypto and others), all while ensuring that all payments are safe, secure and seamless.\n\nWe do SO by:\n\n- Driving growth in consumer payments with a focus on accelerating digitization, growing acceptance and pursuing an expanded set of use cases, including through partnerships\n\n- Capturing new payment flows by expanding our multi-rail capabilities and applications to penetrate key flows such as disbursements and remittances, commercial point-of-sale transactions, business-to-business (B2B) accounts payable flows and consumer bill payments\n\n- Leaning into new payment innovations such as our piloting in 2022 of Mastercard Installments (our buy-now-pay-later solution) and developing solutions that support digital currencies and blockchain applications\n\nExtend our services. Our services drive value for our customers and the broader payments ecosystem.

Our Board of Directors oversees Mastercard's strategic direction and the performance of our business and management. Our governance structure enables independent, experienced, diverse and accomplished directors to provide advice, insight, guidance and oversight to advance the interests of the company and our stockholders. We have long maintained strong governance standards and a commitment to transparent financial reporting and strong internal controls.\n\n02\n\n23\n\n# Proposal 1: Election of directors\n\n## Election process\n\nEach member of our Board is elected annually by our Class A stockholders for a one-year term that expires at our next annual meeting. When our Board members are elected, they also are automatically appointed as directors of our operating subsidiary, Mastercard International Incorporated (Mastercard International). Our directors are elected by an affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting of stockholders, subject to our majority voting policy. You can find more about this in \"About the Annual Meeting and voting\" on pg 138.\n\n## Refreshing the Board and nominating directors\n\nOur Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (NCG) reviews and selects candidates for nomination to our Board in accordance with its charter. Based on its review, coupled with our age and tenure limits, the NCG determines whether Board refreshment is needed in the near future. The NCG then identifies nominees who would be valuable assets to our Board and to Mastercard.

To assist in its independence determinations, the Board has adopted director independence standards as part of our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which you can find on our website at https://investor.mastercard.com/corporate-governance/governance- guidelines/default.aspx.\n\nNo director or director nominee will be considered independent unless the Board affirmatively determines that such individual has (or would have) no material relationship with Mastercard (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with Mastercard) other than as a Board or committee member. Additional requirements apply to Audit Committee and HRCC members. When making independence determinations, the Board broadly considers all relevant facts and circumstances, as well as any other facts and considerations specified by the NYSE, by law, or by any rule or regulation of any other regulatory body or self-regulatory body applicable to Mastercard When assessing the materiality of a director's relationship with Mastercard, the Board considers the issue not merely from the standpoint of the director or director nominee but also from that of persons or organizations with which such individual has an affiliation. Material relationships can include commercial, industrial, banking, consulting, legal, accounting, charitable and familial relationships (among others). In addition, the Board applies the independence guidelines set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which generally track the independence standards set by the NYSE.\n\nIn determining the independence of each current non-management director and director nominee, the Board considered any transactions, relationships and arrangements as required by the NYSE Listed Company Manual and under the independence requirements adopted by the Board.

Each director selects the form of his or her award during an annual election process. Directors elected to the Board outside of the annual meeting of stockholders are granted a prorated equity award.\n\nNon-employee directors are eligible to have Mastercard make matching gift contributions of up to $15,000 annually to eligible charities in the name of the director. In addition, non-employee directors are eligible to have Mastercard make contributions up to $5,000 to a charity of their choice to match director contributions to Mastercard's Political Action Committee. Directors are reimbursed for expenses related to attending Board and committee meetings.\n\n## Director stock ownership guidelines\n\nEach non-employee director is expected, within six years of joining the Board, to accumulate an ownership position in our stock equal to five times the applicable annual cash retainer.

Our compensation and benefit programs are significantly performance-based and are designed to attract, retain and motivate our NEOs, who are critical to our success, and to align their interests with those of our stockholders. Our Board continues to believe that our executive compensation program and policies are effective in achieving these core principles.\n\nThe HRCC routinely reviews the compensation and benefit programs for our NEOs to ensure that they achieve the desired goals of closely aligning our executive compensation with performance and with our stockholders' interests. These reviews have resulted in a number of changes over the last several years.\n\nWe are asking stockholders to indicate their support for our NEO compensation as described in this proxy statement. This proposal, commonly known as a say-on-pay proposal, gives stockholders the opportunity to endorse or not endorse our executive compensation program. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, we are asking stockholders to vote FOR the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:\n\n\"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to Mastercard's named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to the SEC rules, including the compensation discussion and analysis, compensation tables and any related narrative discussion, is hereby approved.\"\n\nBecause this vote is advisory, it will not be binding on Mastercard, the Board or the HRCC.

Mastercard maintains several benefit plans and programs in which the NEOs may be eligible to participate. These plans and programs include:\n\n- Mastercard Savings Plan (Savings Plan): a 401(k) retirement plan for U.S. employees, including NEOs. The components of the plan include employee contributions on a before-tax, Roth IRA and/or after-tax basis and an employer matching contribution. The employer matching contribution was 167% of the employee contributions (up to 6% of eligible compensation). Eligible compensation in the Savings Plan is limited to base salary, up to the applicable IRS limit, which was $305,000 for 2022.\n\n- Restoration Program: an arrangement for certain highly compensated U.S. employees, including the NEOs, that restores missed employer contributions due to the compensation limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the 401(k) Savings Plan. Under the Restoration Program, each eligible employee receives an annual contribution for the difference between (1) employer contributions the employee would have been eligible to receive for the calendar year under the Savings Plan if the compensation limit did not apply and (2) the maximum employer contribution up to the compensation limit of 401(a)(17) under the Savings Plan.\n\n- Mastercard's health and welfare programs: Health and welfare programs are available to all U.S. employees working a minimum of 76 hours per month, including the NEOs. These programs include medical, dental, vision, flexible spending accounts, health savings accounts, life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, disability insurance and business travel accident insurance. In addition, medical, dental and life insurance coverage is available for retirees. Employees who were hired on or before June 30, 2007 are eligible for an employer subsidy that reduces the retiree's cost for participating in the medical and dental programs. The amount of the subsidy is based on the employee's age and service upon retirement.

Mr. Miebach's annual total compensation for 2022 as reported in the Summary Compensation Table was $21,058,543. Accordingly, for 2022, the ratio of the compensation of our CEO to the compensation for our median employee was estimated to be 163 to 1.\n\nConsistent with last year, we used the following methodology to identify the median employee:\n\nWe\n\n- collected employee data of all employees globally, whether employed on a full-time, part-time or temporary basis as of December 31,\n\n2022\n\nWe\n\n31,\n\n2022\n\n- annualized the compensation of all new employees (other than temporary employees) who were hired by the company between January 1\nto reflect their estimated compensation over the entire year\n\nand\n\nDecember\n\n\t- We applied an exchange rate as of December 1, 2022 to convert all international currencies into U.S. dollars\n\n\t- We used total base pay and annual bonus target as of December 31, 2022 and actual long-term incentive award granted in 2022 as our consistently applied compensation measure\n\n\t- Three employees were originally identified as at the same median annual compensation level.

Following ISO's decision, on 4 September 28, 2022, in light of interest around ISO's decision and to correct misperceptions about some of Mastercard's standards, Mastercard published a description on our website of the principles that have been central to how we have operated our network for nearly 60 years (MCC Principles). 5 The MCC Principles explain that the standards and principles that govern our network are grounded in the rule of law. Quite simply, we allow all lawful purchases on the network. Our principles ensure the application of a clear, consistent and reliable standard upon which consumers, businesses and governments across the world can understand and rely.\n\nMastercard previously announced its commitment to adopt an MCC for standalone firearm and ammunition merchants. Subsequent to the ISO's decision, on October 19, 2022, Mastercard formally published an announcement to our customers classified as AN 7002 Revised Standards for a New Card Acceptor Business Code (the Customer Announcement) informing our customers of a revision to the Mastercard Standards for a New Card Acceptor Business Code with a new \"MCC Description,\" specifically for \"Retailers primarily engaged in the sale of firearms and ammunition.\"\n\nMastercard advised customers that they should review the revisions and make appropriate plans to support the new MCC. The effective date for implementation, April 14, 2023 at the time of this announcement, was intended to facilitate an expected industry-wide implementation of the new MCC across payment networks.\n\nSubsequently, the new MCC became the subject of multiple sources of legislation, leading US to pause the planned implementation, with the oversight of our Board. After our October 2022 Customer Announcement, a number of states introduced legislation related to the use of the new MCC. As of the last week of April, 12 bills are pending, including conflicting legislation within some of the same states. Recently, three states - Idaho, Mississippi and West Virginia - enacted legislation that either prohibits use of the new MCC or imposes restrictions on its use. Legislation pending in additional states is expected to be enacted shortly.

Mastercard has not changed its advance notice bylaws since 2008. The bylaws currently require the nomination of candidates between 120 and 90 days before the anniversary date of the prior year annual meeting. The bylaws currently do not require nominating stockholders to disclose the identity of their limited partners.\n\nThe proposal requires stockholder approval if the bylaws are amended to ask for additional disclosure about director candidates nominated by stockholders (\"stockholder nominees\"). This provision is overly broad and restrictive. This provision would require the company to seek stockholder approval, and delay effecting the bylaws, even if the company asks those stockholder nominees for the exact same information that it asks from its own nominees.\n\nHaving accurate information from stockholder nominees is increasingly important since Mastercard will be including the stockholder nominees on the company's proxy card as a result of the universal proxy rules. The proposal does not afford our Board with any discretion to implement any kinds of additional disclosure requirements about the stockholder nominees, including making minor and administrative changes, changes that reflect the latest developments in the law and comply with new legal requirements, or any other changes that it considers appropriate and in the best interests of the company and our stockholders.\n\nWithout this flexibility, the Board would need to wait for action at a stockholders' meeting to ensure its bylaw amendments are ultimately operative, which would be an expensive and time-consuming process that could cause uncertainty.\n\nMastercard has strong corporate governance practices and a record of accountability and robust stockholder engagement. The Board is committed to its practices of strong corporate governance and responsiveness to stockholders. The company believes that the proposal requesting stockholder approval of certain bylaw amendments adopted by the Board is unnecessary in light of its strong governance practices. These governance features include:\n\na. Annual election of directors.\n\nb. Majority voting for director nominees.\n\nC. Independent Chair of the Board.\n\nd.

Our commitment to inclusion is gimed at advancing our business, engaging our people, and supporting the societies we serve in the more than 210 countries and territories in which we conduct business. For over 15 years, we have drawn on our role in the payments ecosystem to drive financial inclusion and support the financial needs of small businesses and individuals. We drive innovation in a way that expands the middle class and helps the underserved with our goal of long-term financial security for all. These efforts open new markets for our business and create long-term customers. Our business thrives when these individuals and businesses prosper.\n\nWe continuously look for ways to innovate with inclusivity in mind. In October 2021, Mastercard introduced the Touch Card - an accessible card standard for the benefit of the 2.2 billion blind and partially sighted people around the world - enhancing access to the company's products and services while also providing the possibility of a greater sense of security, inclusivity and independence. Similarly, we have also pledged to support micro and small businesses, women entrepreneurs and Black communities.\n\nThese are just a few powerful examples of how Mastercard promotes diversity, equity and inclusion across our network, reflecting the principles we have adopted since our founding about using our network to connect people to opportunity, respecting individual customer choices and fostering a culture of decency. 2\n\nMastercard invests in diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace because we believe people thrive when they feel they belong, their ideas are valued and they are treated fairly. Mastercard is committed to creating a global corporate environment where all people are treated equally and fairly and have equal access to opportunities and advancement. For example, in 2021, our global pay equity ratio for women versus men was $1.00 to $1.00, and in the U.S., Black, Hispanic and Asian employees earn $1.00 for every $1.00 earned by white employees.\n\nWe also strive to develop a workforce and management and leadership teams that reflect the identities, experiences and perspectives of the more than 210 countries and territories we serve. Our Global Inclusion Report provides details regarding our approach to hiring. In 2021, the vast majority of our final candidate interviews in the U.S. included a person of color candidate and globally included a woman, and 51% of our new hires in the U.S. were people of color and 41% of our global new hires were women.
