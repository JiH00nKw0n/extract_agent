We'll hold this year's meeting on February 28, 2024, and as always, I hope you'll join us.\n\nIt's been a remarkable year. In 2023, we made history by introducing the world to Apple's first spatial computer, Apple Vision Pro - a revolutionary product that seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world, opening a whole new dimension for our users. We also launched our powerful iPhone 15 lineup - including the iPhone 15 Pro models - which continues to win over customers around the world with its profound innovations.\n\nWe're a company that's always looking forward, driven by a belief in the meaningful difference technology can make for our customers. Today - from iPad to Mac, AirPods to Apple Watch - we've never had a stronger lineup of products. And with services like Apple TV+, the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and many more, we've only expanded the potential and possibility Apple can bring - from helping people find connection, entertainment and joy, to empowering them to live healthier lives.\n\nWe've done all of this while continuing to lead with our values in everything we do. That's why we've put our users' fundamental right to privacy at the center of everything we do, and continued innovating to protect it. We've built accessibility into every product we make from the ground up, because we believe the best technology should be the best technology for everyone. And we've continued to push forward in our work to build an even more diverse and inclusive Apple, and to carry those values beyond our doors with our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative.\n\nOur teams are also pressing forward to meet the challenge of climate change. Our corporate operations have run on 100% renewable energy since 2018, and with our latest Apple Watch lineup, we've now launched our first- ever carbon neutral models. Thanks to milestones like these, we're closer than ever to realizing Apple 2030 - our goal to become carbon neutral for our supply chain and the lifetime of our products by the end of the decade.\n\nAs companies and individuals, our values give us purpose, our goals give us direction, and our progress gives us hope.

Behind every innovation, there are so many talented teams who collaborate to create incredible products and services for Apple users around the world. And following the expansion of our charter in 2023, the People and Compensation Committee will do even more to support Apple's teams - including oversight of our investments in employee engagement, inclusion and diversity, talent recruitment, development, and retention.\n\nOf course, Apple's leadership plays a key role in fostering a culture of collaboration - driving innovation and charting a course for the future. Our executive compensation program aims to reflect these important contributions, from leaders whose vision is so essential to Apple's continued success. It also reflects feedback from our shareholders - which is an important consideration every year as we evaluate the compensation of our executive officers.\n\nThat includes our Chief Executive Officer - Tim Cook - whose outstanding leadership has been crucial to Apple's success and its enduring track record of innovation. Tim continues to distinguish himself as a responsible, thoughtful, and visionary leader guiding Apple. Under his leadership, the company continues to empower people with innovative technology, while staying true to the values and the spirit of ingenuity that have long guided its work, and over the past three years, Apple's total shareholder return is more than 55% - nearly 20% above the S&P 500.\n\nAs a committee, we have a responsibility to ensure that the compensation of our CEO reflects the success of our Company and the excellence of its leadership. Last year, our committee shared its intention to set Tim's compensation between the 80th and 90th percentiles of target CEO pay at our primary peer companies, and 89% of votes cast on the Say on Pay proposal at the 2023 Annual Meeting were in favor of Apple's executive compensation program. We believe positioning Tim's compensation at this level is responsive to shareholder feedback and appropriate given Apple's relative size and scope compared to our peer companies.", "blocks": [{"type": "Text", "bbox": {"left": 0.20509420335292816, "top": 0.2262079119682312, "width": 0.5439293384552002, "height": 0.057371046394109726, "page": 41}, "content": "\"Apple's leadership plays a key role in fostering a culture of collaboration - driving innovation and charting a course for the future.\""}, {"type": "Text", "bbox": {"left": 0.5933027267456055, "top": 0.2945711612701416, "width": 0.20937609672546387, "height": 0.009087976068258286, "page": 41}, "content": "- People and Compensation Committee"}, {"type": "Figure", "bbox": {"left": 0.49293583631515503, "top": 0.5828530192375183, "width": 0.021460948511958122, "height": 0.01854209043085575, "page": 41}, "content": "u"}, {"type": "Header", "bbox": {"left": 0.05535779520869255, "top": 0.02379786968231201, "width": 0.0981500968337059, "height": 0.007513899821788073, "page": 42}, "content": "Back to Contents"}, {"type": "Header", "bbox": {"left": 0.0536528155207634, "top": 0.04176020622253418, "width": 0.04780982807278633, "height": 0.009082076139748096, "page": 42}, "content": "Summary"}, {"type": "Header", "bbox": {"left": 0.12916721403598785, "top": 0.043481651693582535, "width": 0.057039495557546616, "height": 0.006462429650127888, "page": 42}, "content": "Governance"}, {"type": "Header", "bbox": {"left": 0.21521972119808197, "top": 0.043351344764232635, "width": 0.04217594861984253, "height": 0.006685949396342039, "page": 42}, "content": "Directors"}, {"type": "Header", "bbox": {"left": 0.2874971330165863, "top": 0.04256915673613548, "width": 0.07354907691478729, "height": 0.008474835194647312, "page": 42}, "content": "Compensation"}, {"type": "Header", "bbox": {"left": 0.39202630519866943, "top": 0.04297683760523796, "width": 0.1576084941625595, "height": 0.008575269021093845, "page": 42}, "content": "Proposals\nOther Information"}, {"type": "Header", "bbox": {"left": 0.8150569200515747, "top": 0.0425543338060379, "width": 0.10461700707674026, "height": 0.008334760554134846, "page": 42}, "content": "2024 Proxy Statement"}, {"type": "Page Number", "bbox": {"left": 0.9390265941619873, "top": 0.04382314532995224, "width": 0.013743564486503601, "height": 0.007260681129992008, "page": 42}, "content": "45"}, {"type": "Figure", "bbox": {"left": 0.053727466613054276, "top": 0.07805692404508591, "width": 0.19439198076725006, "height": 0.1118779107928276, "page": 42}, "content": ""}, {"type": "Text", "bbox": {"left": 0.054863400757312775, "top": 0.20106443762779236, "width": 0.11361774802207947, "height": 0.00955271441489458, "page": 42}, "content": "Andrea Jung (Chair)"}, {"type": "Figure", "bbox": {"left": 0.054094091057777405, "top": 0.22147758305072784, "width": 0.1935872733592987, "height": 0.11150721460580826, "page": 42}, "content": ""}, {"type": "Text", "bbox": {"left": 0.05509769171476364, "top": 0.3439297676086426, "width": 0.043671056628227234, "height": 0.0072880694642663, "page": 42}, "content": "Al Gore"}, {"type": "Figure", "bbox": {"left": 0.054208651185035706, "top": 0.36554160714149475, "width": 0.19404222071170807, "height": 0.1107816994190216, "page": 42}, "content": ""}, {"type": "Text", "bbox": {"left": 0.05496043711900711, "top": 0.4872850477695465, "width": 0.07067429274320602, "height": 0.008913538418710232, "page": 42}, "content": "Alex Gorsky"}, {"type": "Figure", "bbox": {"left": 0.05336621031165123, "top": 0.507184624671936, "width": 0.19384236633777618, "height": 0.11019822955131531, "page": 42}, "content": ""}, {"type": "Title", "bbox": {"left": 0.28949859738349915, "top": 0.0804794579744339, "width": 0.42946216464042664, "height": 0.03737163171172142, "page": 42}, "content": "Message from the People and Compensation Committee"}, {"type": "Section Header", "bbox": {"left": 0.2887389361858368, "top": 0.14405617117881775, "width": 0.16910070180892944, "height": 0.009592080488801003, "page": 42}, "content": "Dear Fellow Shareholders,"}, {"type": "Text", "bbox": {"left": 0.2878645658493042, "top": 0.1652192771434784, "width": 0.6643012166023254, "height": 0.022798758000135422, "page": 42}, "content": "On behalf of Apple's Board of Directors, we want to thank you for your investment in our Company - and for your continued support for its people, its leadership, and the values that guide it."}, {"type": "Text", "bbox": {"left": 0.28780582547187805, "top": 0.19875597953796387, "width": 0.664814829826355, "height": 0.0557028166949749, "page": 42}, "content": "Apple is a company where people come together to do the best work of their lives.

The compensation recoupment policy also applies to the awards and payout opportunities granted under the Cash Incentive Plan to our executive officers. Apple may recover compensation in the event a named executive officer commits a felony while employed by Apple or, while employed by Apple or at any time thereafter, a named executive officer engages in a breach of confidentiality; materially breaches any agreement with Apple; commits an act of theft, embezzlement or fraud; or if Apple is required to prepare an accounting restatement as a result of the named executive officer's misconduct.

Operating Income and Net Sales are the two financial performance measures for our Cash Incentive Plan.\n\n## Relationship Between Compensation Actually Paid and Net Sales\n\nNet Sales is one of the two financial measures, the People and Compensation Committee has set for our Cash Incentive Plan, and therefore along with Operating Income is the next most important financial metric in determining Compensation Actually Paid behind Relative TSR.

We believe that adopting an ethical framework for the use of Al technology will strengthen our company's position as a responsible and sustainable leader in its industry. By addressing the ethical considerations of AI in a transparent manner, we can build trust among our company's stakeholders and contribute positively to society.\n\nThe adoption of Al technology into business raises a number of significant social policy issues. For example, the use of Al in human resources decisions may raise concerns about discrimination or bias against employees. The use of Al to automate jobs may result in mass layoffs and the closing of entire facilities. Al may be used in ways that violate the privacy of customers and members of the public. AI technology may be used to generate \"deep fake\" media content that may result in the dissemination of false information in political elections.\n\nThe White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has developed a set of ethical guidelines to help guide the design, use, and deployment of Al.

This proposal addresses our use of artificial intelligence across our \"business operations.\" The proposal does not focus on any specific novel use of AI at Apple and, in fact, references well-established applications of software such as automation of systems. Broadly defined, the requested report could encompass every aspect of our business, including whether and how we use automated systems in, for example, product development and research, supply chain management, financial management and planning, efficient management of energy use throughout our physical plant and buildings, monitoring of cyber and physical security at our facilities, coordinating employee benefit or other personnel programs, and conducting a wide range of other aspects of our business operations.\n\nBeyond our business operations, due to its broad nature, the requested report would cover virtually every product and service Apple currently offers. To cite a few examples, SiriTM, which has been available for more than a decade, Personal Voice and Live Voicemail included in iOS 17, and life saving features like Fall Detection, Crash Detection, and ECG, would simply not be possible without the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The broad scope of the proposal therefore speaks against preparing the report requested, especially as the proponent does not point to any specific use of AI at Apple that raises concerns. Not only would the report encompass every aspect of our operations and nearly every product or service we build, it could also cover competitively harmful disclosure of confidential research and development activities.\n\nThe AI regulatory landscape is rapidly evolving. Apple has been and will continue to be deliberate and thoughtful in the development and deployment of artificial intelligence.
