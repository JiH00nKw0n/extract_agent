Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThis section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\n\nAvailable Information\n\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\n\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\n\nFiscal Period\n\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively.\n\nQuarterly Highlights\n\nWeakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on the Company’s total net sales, which decreased 1% or $1.2 billion during the third quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022. The year-over-year net sales decrease consisted primarily of lower net sales of iPad and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, the Company announced the following new products:\n\n•15-inch MacBook Air®, powered by the M2 chip;\n\n•Mac StudioTM, powered by the M2 Max chip and the new M2 Ultra chip;\n\n•Mac Pro®, powered by the new M2 Ultra chip; and\n\n•Apple Vision ProTM, the Company’s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOSTM, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024.\n\nThe Company also announced iOS 17, macOS® Sonoma, iPadOS® 17, tvOS® 17 and watchOS® 10, updates to its operating systems that are expected to be available in the fall of 2023.\n\nApple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 14"}
