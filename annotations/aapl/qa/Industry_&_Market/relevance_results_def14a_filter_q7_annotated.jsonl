And I'm grateful for the confidence our shareholders have shown in supporting our mission.\n\nOur annual shareholder meeting is an opportunity to reflect on where we are today, and to look toward a future defined by innovation. We'll hold this year's meeting on February 28, 2024, and as always, I hope you'll join us.\n\nIt's been a remarkable year. In 2023, we made history by introducing the world to Apple's first spatial computer, Apple Vision Pro - a revolutionary product that seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world, opening a whole new dimension for our users. We also launched our powerful iPhone 15 lineup - including the iPhone 15 Pro models - which continues to win over customers around the world with its profound innovations.\n\nWe're a company that's always looking forward, driven by a belief in the meaningful difference technology can make for our customers. Today - from iPad to Mac, AirPods to Apple Watch - we've never had a stronger lineup of products. And with services like Apple TV+, the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and many more, we've only expanded the potential and possibility Apple can bring - from helping people find connection, entertainment and joy, to empowering them to live healthier lives.\n\nWe've done all of this while continuing to lead with our values in everything we do. That's why we've put our users' fundamental right to privacy at the center of everything we do, and continued innovating to protect it. We've built accessibility into every product we make from the ground up, because we believe the best technology should be the best technology for everyone. And we've continued to push forward in our work to build an even more diverse and inclusive Apple, and to carry those values beyond our doors with our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative.\n\nOur teams are also pressing forward to meet the challenge of climate change. Our corporate operations have run on 100% renewable energy since 2018, and with our latest Apple Watch lineup, we've now launched our first- ever carbon neutral models. Thanks to milestones like these, we're closer than ever to realizing Apple 2030 - our goal to become carbon neutral for our supply chain and the lifetime of our products by the end of the decade.\n\nAs companies and individuals, our values give us purpose, our goals give us direction, and our progress gives us hope. And at Apple, we'll continue to innovate in the belief that - with hope and hard work - there is nothing we can't achieve."}

These factors included anticipated foreign currency headwinds, the ongoing uneven macroeconomic environment and the continuing effects of the prolonged uncertainty caused by the COVID- 19 pandemic including, country-specific policies and lockdowns. Accordingly, the People and Compensation Committee determined that focusing on the underlying business performance was an appropriate method of evaluating the 2023 performance goals. The Committee believed that attaining similar underlying performance to 2022's record-breaking net sales and operating income results would require a high level of performance given these factors, and set the target goals at this level.\n\nFor 2023, the Company's total net sales decreased 3%. However, the weakness in foreign exchange relative to the US dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales. On an underlying basis, the company delivered strong performance in a challenging environment driven by all-time high revenue records in emerging markets, and we achieved an all-time revenue record in Services. The Company was also thoughtful and deliberate on spending while driving cost and gross margins improvements throughout the year. Overall, we reported net sales of $383.3 billion and operating income of $114.3 billion. These achievements resulted in 153.1% and 179.1% target payout opportunities, respectively, for an aggregate payout opportunity of 166.1% prior to application of the modifier described below."}
