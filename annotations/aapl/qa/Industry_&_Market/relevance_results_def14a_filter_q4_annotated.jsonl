And I'm grateful for the confidence our shareholders have shown in supporting our mission.\n\nOur annual shareholder meeting is an opportunity to reflect on where we are today, and to look toward a future defined by innovation. We'll hold this year's meeting on February 28, 2024, and as always, I hope you'll join us.\n\nIt's been a remarkable year. In 2023, we made history by introducing the world to Apple's first spatial computer, Apple Vision Pro - a revolutionary product that seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world, opening a whole new dimension for our users. We also launched our powerful iPhone 15 lineup - including the iPhone 15 Pro models - which continues to win over customers around the world with its profound innovations.\n\nWe're a company that's always looking forward, driven by a belief in the meaningful difference technology can make for our customers. Today - from iPad to Mac, AirPods to Apple Watch - we've never had a stronger lineup of products. And with services like Apple TV+, the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and many more, we've only expanded the potential and possibility Apple can bring - from helping people find connection, entertainment and joy, to empowering them to live healthier lives.\n\nWe've done all of this while continuing to lead with our values in everything we do. That's why we've put our users' fundamental right to privacy at the center of everything we do, and continued innovating to protect it. We've built accessibility into every product we make from the ground up, because we believe the best technology should be the best technology for everyone. And we've continued to push forward in our work to build an even more diverse and inclusive Apple, and to carry those values beyond our doors with our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative.\n\nOur teams are also pressing forward to meet the challenge of climate change. Our corporate operations have run on 100% renewable energy since 2018, and with our latest Apple Watch lineup, we've now launched our first- ever carbon neutral models. Thanks to milestones like these, we're closer than ever to realizing Apple 2030 - our goal to become carbon neutral for our supply chain and the lifetime of our products by the end of the decade.\n\nAs companies and individuals, our values give us purpose, our goals give us direction, and our progress gives us hope. And at Apple, we'll continue to innovate in the belief that - with hope and hard work - there is nothing we can't achieve."}

The threshold revenue and market capitalization requirements for a company to be considered for the primary peer group for 2023 were $20 billion and $100 billion, respectively at the time the 2023 peer group was set. Based on the above criteria, the People and Compensation Committee removed Charter Communications and IBM and added Mastercard Incorporated, Tesla, Inc. and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. to the primary peer group for 2023. The 2023 primary group includes Alphabet, Amazon, AT&T, Cisco, Comcast, Disney, Intel, Mastercard, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix, Oracle, Qualcomm, Salesforce, Tesla, Verizon, Visa, and Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nA secondary peer group of companies that have iconic brands or are industry or category leaders, rely on significant research and development, and innovation for growth, and require highly-skilled employees has been developed as an additional reference set, primarily to compare pay practices. The 2023 secondary peer group includes 3M, AbbVie, The Coca-Cola Company, Johnson & Johnson, Nike, PepsiCo, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, Starbucks, and UnitedHealth Group.\n\nAs shown in the chart above, Apple remains considerably larger than the typical company in the primary peer group. Apple has approximately four times the revenue and approximately twelve times the market capitalization of the median peer companies in its primary peer group. Apple's size and scope with respect to its primary peer companies in terms of revenue and market capitalization supports our CEO's total target compensation positioning between the 80th to 90th percentile of CEO total target compensation at these companies.\n\n## The Role of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nAt the People and Compensation Committee's request, Mr. Cook provides input regarding the performance and compensation of the other named executive officers. The People and Compensation Committee considers Mr. Cook's evaluation and his direct knowledge of each named executive officer's performance and contributions when setting compensation. Mr. Cook is not present during People and Compensation Committee voting or deliberations regarding his own compensation.\n\n## Components of Named Executive Officer Compensation\n\nThe target total compensation of our named executive officers has three basic components: annual base salary, annual cash incentive, and long-term equity awards.\n\n2023 Components of Total Target Compensation"}
