And I'm grateful for the confidence our shareholders have shown in supporting our mission.\n\nOur annual shareholder meeting is an opportunity to reflect on where we are today, and to look toward a future defined by innovation. We'll hold this year's meeting on February 28, 2024, and as always, I hope you'll join us.\n\nIt's been a remarkable year. In 2023, we made history by introducing the world to Apple's first spatial computer, Apple Vision Pro - a revolutionary product that seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world, opening a whole new dimension for our users. We also launched our powerful iPhone 15 lineup - including the iPhone 15 Pro models - which continues to win over customers around the world with its profound innovations.\n\nWe're a company that's always looking forward, driven by a belief in the meaningful difference technology can make for our customers. Today - from iPad to Mac, AirPods to Apple Watch - we've never had a stronger lineup of products. And with services like Apple TV+, the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, and many more, we've only expanded the potential and possibility Apple can bring - from helping people find connection, entertainment and joy, to empowering them to live healthier lives.\n\nWe've done all of this while continuing to lead with our values in everything we do. That's why we've put our users' fundamental right to privacy at the center of everything we do, and continued innovating to protect it. We've built accessibility into every product we make from the ground up, because we believe the best technology should be the best technology for everyone. And we've continued to push forward in our work to build an even more diverse and inclusive Apple, and to carry those values beyond our doors with our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative.\n\nOur teams are also pressing forward to meet the challenge of climate change. Our corporate operations have run on 100% renewable energy since 2018, and with our latest Apple Watch lineup, we've now launched our first- ever carbon neutral models. Thanks to milestones like these, we're closer than ever to realizing Apple 2030 - our goal to become carbon neutral for our supply chain and the lifetime of our products by the end of the decade.\n\nAs companies and individuals, our values give us purpose, our goals give us direction, and our progress gives us hope. And at Apple, we'll continue to innovate in the belief that - with hope and hard work - there is nothing we can't achieve."}

We are therefore greatly concerned at recent reports of Apple arbitrarily limiting content access within its online services, as detailed below. This censorship endangers Apple's trust with its users and jeopardizes Apple's stated commitments to human lightsandproviding quality products.Shareholders must know that Applewill meaningfully commit to protecting reliable app access as a crucial aspect of both good social policy and respecting its users' civil liberties.\n\nApple has defended the connection between human rights and technological access in its Commitment to Human Rights (1) further asserting its primary emphasis on maintaining users' \"access to reliable information and helpful technology.\" Yet, recent actions call the veracity of such commitments into question.\n\nApple has been characterized by the 1792 Exchange as \"leverag[ing] its corporate reputation and funds to support. groups hostile to freedom of expression,\" most recently the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Reporting indicates Apple's removal of popular Quran (2) (Quran Majeed) and Bible (3) (Olive Tree) reading apps from its App Store in China, at the request of authorities within the CCP. Furthermore, as detailed in the 2022 edition of the Viewpoint Diversity Index (4) Apple does not provide a clear standard as to what apps are and not allowed on its platforms, indicating a concerning absence of protocol to determine what content is permissible (5) further amplified by recent concerns over Apple's threat to remove Twitter (X) from its App Store (6) a seemingly political swipe that conservative lawmakers have characterized as a \"raw exercise of monopolistic power.\" (7) These actions conflict with Apple's stated Commitment to Human Rights and the interest of millions of Apple's users in reliably accessing content. Furthermore, the perception that Apple does not respect the civil liberties of its users and vendors creates significant reputational risk and risk of political backlash, threatening shareholder value.\n\n(1) https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_downloads/gov_docs/2020/Apple-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf\n\n(2) htps://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58921230\n\n(3) https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-takes-down-quran-bible-jehovahs-witenss-apps-in-china-2021-\n\n(4) htps://www.viewpointdiversityscore.org/business-index\n\n(5) https://1792exchange.com/pdf/?c_id=667\n\n(6) https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/28/tech/elon-musk-twitter-apple-app-store/index.html)"}

We're required to comply with local laws, and at times there are complex issues about which we may disagree with governments \"\n\nWhile any freedom-loving individual would likely admire such principles, Apple appears to implement - or rescind - them inconsistently across countries where it conducts business, and incongruently with its principles.\n\nFor example in China, the Company severely restricted use of its AirDrop wireless filesharing feature on users' iPhones during protests against Chairman Xi Jinping's \"zero COVID\" policies in late 2022. (3) Similarly, in 2017 Apple removed the New York Times's apps from the App Store in China in 2017, (4) and removed apps including HKmap.live and Quartz from its offerings, during the protests in Hong Kong in 2019.

(6) \"We are deeply concerned about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and stand with all of the people who are suffering as a result of the violence,\" said an Apple spokesman. As a result, Apple stood to lose as much as $1.14 billion (U.S.) annually in iPhone sales alone, and the decision removed access to Apple's critical communications and services for victims of the war. (7)\n\nConsidering these examples, it appears the Company's principles to \"empower and connect people\" as \"a force for good\" - while remaining \"engaged\" even where it disagrees with a government and its laws, by still making its products \"available\" to users - has its limits.\n\nResolved: Shareholders request the Board of Directors issue a report by March 31,2025, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary or confidential information, analyzing the congruency of the Company's privacy and human rights policy positions with its actions, especially in such places as war zones and under oppressive regimes, as they impact how the Company maintains its reputation, viability and profitability.\n\n(1) htps://www.apple.com/privacy/govemment-information-requests/\n\n- (2)https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_downloads/gov_docs/2020/Apple-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf"}
