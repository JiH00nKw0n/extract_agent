The results of the Say on Pay advisory vote at the 2022 Annual Meeting led to broader shareholder engagement on executive compensation. The People and Compensation Committee balanced shareholder feedback, Apple's exceptional performance, and a recommendation from Mr. Cook to adjust his compensation in light of the feedback received. It then approved the target annual compensation of our named executive officers for 2023, including the following changes to CEO compensation, which Mr. Cook supported, and which the People and Compensation Committee believes are responsive to shareholder feedback, while continuing to align pay with performance and recognize Mr. Cook's outstanding leadership and the exceptional long-term results he delivers to shareholders.\n\nTarget CEO Pay\n\nMr. Cook's 2023 target total compensation was $49 million, a reduction of over 40% from his 2022 target total compensation. Taking into consideration Apple's comparative size, scope, and success, the People and Compensation Committee also intends to position Mr. Cook's annual target compensation between the 80th and 90th percentiles relative to our primary peer group for future years.\n\nCEO Equity Mix\n\nThe portion of performance-based RSUs granted to Mr. Cook was increased from 50% to 75% of his 2023 target equity award and the portion of his performance-based RSUs will be at least 75% of his target equity awards for future years.\n\nCEO Retirement Vesting\n\nThe time-based RSUs awarded to Mr. Cook in 2023 provide for pro-rata instead of full vesting in the event of retirement during the term of the award and only if retirement occurs on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. The People and Compensation Committee intends to maintain this same structure for future years.\n\nFor more information on our executive compensation program and the 2023 compensation of our named executive officers, see the section entitled \"Compensation Discussion and Analysis\" beginning on page 46."}

The Deferred Compensation Plan is unfunded and unsecured. We do not provide any matching contributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan or allow for deferral of RSUs.

Shares may be owned directly by the individual, owned jointly with, or separately by, the individual's spouse, or held in trust for the benefit of the individual, the individual's spouse, or the individual's children. Other than Mr. Gorsky, who joined the Board in calendar year 2021, each Non-Employee Director currently owns shares of Apple's common stock that have a value at least equal to five times their annual cash retainer."}

The compensation paid to our executive officers in 2023 aligns with the continued strength of our financial results in an uneven macroeconomic environment and the significant progress made across our core values and key community initiatives.\n\nThe vast majority of our named executive officers' compensation is delivered through long-term equity awards. The performance-based equity awards that vested in 2023 reflected Apple's exceptional stock price performance for the three fiscal year period from the start of 2020 through the end of 2022. Apple's total shareholder return relative to other companies in the S&P 500 (\"Relative TSR\") was at the 98th percentile for this performance period. As a result, in 2023 each of our named executive officers, other than Mr. Cook who did not have a performance-based RSU award scheduled to vest in 2023, vested in the maximum number of performance-based RSUs.\n\n## Our 2023 Named Executive Officers\n\nTim Cook Chief Executive Officer\n\nLuca Maestri Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nKate Adams Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary\n\nDeirdre O'Brien Senior Vice President, Retail\n\nJeff Williams Chief Operating Officer"}

As the final vesting tranches of the 2011 Award approached, the People and Compensation Committee evaluated Mr. Cook's equity compensation structure in light of the rapid growth and unparalleled success that Apple had achieved under Mr. Cook's leadership. The People and Compensation Committee also considered the strong compensation structure and practices that had developed for our other named executive officers, and the differences that had developed between the structure of Mr. Cook's long-term equity incentives and the long-term equity incentives awarded to our other named executive officers annually since 2014. Taking these factors into consideration, Mr. Cook was granted an equity award in 2021 for the first time since he was promoted to CEO and a second award, identical in amount and structure, was granted for 2022.\n\nIn 2023, Mr. Cook was granted an equity award with a total target equity grant value of $40 million (\"2023 Equity Award\"), a reduction in value of almost 40% from his 2022 target equity grant value. The 2023 Equity Award was specifically designed to continue to align pay with performance and shareholder interests and recognize Mr. Cook's outstanding leadership. It was further designed to balance shareholder feedback, Apple's exceptional performance, a desire to continue to create meaningful performance and retention incentives, and a recommendation from Mr. Cook to adjust his compensation in light of the feedback received. The People and Compensation Committee also changed the mix of the 2023 Equity Award to increase the performance-based portion of the award from 50% to 75% and reduce the time-based portion of the award from 50% to 25%. The portion of his performance-based RSUs will also be at least 75% for future years. The People and Compensation Committee believes these changes are responsive to shareholder feedback and meet the other objectives it considered for Mr. Cook's compensation, as noted above.\n\n## Alignment with Shareholder Value Creation"}

We also use Relative TSR as the key performance measure for our performance-based RSUs. Over the three-year period covered in this disclosure, Apple's TSR on an absolute basis was high, 55.24%, and outperformed the TSR of our primary peer group by 16.88% Apple's Relative TSR measured against the members of the S&P 500 Index (the peer group for performance-based RSUs) was also strong, resulting in above-target payouts for the performance-based RSUs with applicable performance periods ending in 2021, 2022, and 2023. Further, the TSR relative to the currently outstanding performance-based RSUs (granted in 2022 and 2023) continues to trend towards above-target payouts due to strong TSR relative to the members of the S&P 500. This shows how Compensation Actually Paid to our NEOs and TSR are tightly linked.\n\nThe 2021 Compensation Actually Paid values for the CEO and NEOs are higher than the Summary Compensation Table totals in 2021, and higher than the Compensation Actually Paid values in 2022 and 2023 because Apple's significant and outstanding stock price increase in the years immediately preceding 2021 resulted in our NEOs holding a larger value of unvested equity awards as of the start of 2021.\n\n## Relationship Between Compensation Actually Paid and Net Income\n\nNet Income is generally a key indicator of company profitability and for Apple can contribute to changes in our stock price, which in turn drives Compensation Actually Paid. We do not use Net Income as a financial measure in our executive compensation program but Operating Income from which Net Income is derived. Operating Income and Net Sales are the two financial performance measures for our Cash Incentive Plan.\n\n## Relationship Between Compensation Actually Paid and Net Sales\n\nNet Sales is one of the two financial measures, the People and Compensation Committee has set for our Cash Incentive Plan, and therefore along with Operating Income is the next most important financial metric in determining Compensation Actually Paid behind Relative TSR. Strong performance in Net Sales and Operating Income led to above target bonus payouts in 2021, 2022, and 2023 which in turn increased Compensation Actually Paid.\n\n## Tabular List of Apple's most important metrics that link Compensation Actually Paid to the Mr. Cook and other NEOs\n\nFor 2023, the following list represented the most important financial performance measures used by Apple to link Compensation Actually Paid with our financial performance:"}
