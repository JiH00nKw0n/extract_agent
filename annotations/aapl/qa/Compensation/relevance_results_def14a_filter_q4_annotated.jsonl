The results of the Say on Pay advisory vote at the 2022 Annual Meeting led to broader shareholder engagement on executive compensation. The People and Compensation Committee balanced shareholder feedback, Apple's exceptional performance, and a recommendation from Mr. Cook to adjust his compensation in light of the feedback received. It then approved the target annual compensation of our named executive officers for 2023, including the following changes to CEO compensation, which Mr. Cook supported, and which the People and Compensation Committee believes are responsive to shareholder feedback, while continuing to align pay with performance and recognize Mr. Cook's outstanding leadership and the exceptional long-term results he delivers to shareholders.\n\nTarget CEO Pay\n\nMr. Cook's 2023 target total compensation was $49 million, a reduction of over 40% from his 2022 target total compensation.

The People and Compensation Committee intends to maintain this same structure for future years.\n\nFor more information on our executive compensation program and the 2023 compensation of our named executive officers, see the section entitled \"Compensation Discussion and Analysis\" beginning on page 46."}

Behind every innovation, there are so many talented teams who collaborate to create incredible products and services for Apple users around the world. And following the expansion of our charter in 2023, the People and Compensation Committee will do even more to support Apple's teams - including oversight of our investments in employee engagement, inclusion and diversity, talent recruitment, development, and retention.\n\nOf course, Apple's leadership plays a key role in fostering a culture of collaboration - driving innovation and charting a course for the future. Our executive compensation program aims to reflect these important contributions, from leaders whose vision is so essential to Apple's continued success. It also reflects feedback from our shareholders - which is an important consideration every year as we evaluate the compensation of our executive officers.\n\nThat includes our Chief Executive Officer - Tim Cook - whose outstanding leadership has been crucial to Apple's success and its enduring track record of innovation. Tim continues to distinguish himself as a responsible, thoughtful, and visionary leader guiding Apple. Under his leadership, the company continues to empower people with innovative technology, while staying true to the values and the spirit of ingenuity that have long guided its work, and over the past three years, Apple's total shareholder return is more than 55% - nearly 20% above the S&P 500.\n\nAs a committee, we have a responsibility to ensure that the compensation of our CEO reflects the success of our Company and the excellence of its leadership. Last year, our committee shared its intention to set Tim's compensation between the 80th and 90th percentiles of target CEO pay at our primary peer companies, and 89% of votes cast on the Say on Pay proposal at the 2023 Annual Meeting were in favor of Apple's executive compensation program. We believe positioning Tim's compensation at this level is responsive to shareholder feedback and appropriate given Apple's relative size and scope compared to our peer companies."}

We also use Relative TSR as the key performance measure for our performance-based RSUs. Over the three-year period covered in this disclosure, Apple's TSR on an absolute basis was high, 55.24%, and outperformed the TSR of our primary peer group by 16.88% Apple's Relative TSR measured against the members of the S&P 500 Index (the peer group for performance-based RSUs) was also strong, resulting in above-target payouts for the performance-based RSUs with applicable performance periods ending in 2021, 2022, and 2023. Further, the TSR relative to the currently outstanding performance-based RSUs (granted in 2022 and 2023) continues to trend towards above-target payouts due to strong TSR relative to the members of the S&P 500. This shows how Compensation Actually Paid to our NEOs and TSR are tightly linked.\n\nThe 2021 Compensation Actually Paid values for the CEO and NEOs are higher than the Summary Compensation Table totals in 2021, and higher than the Compensation Actually Paid values in 2022 and 2023 because Apple's significant and outstanding stock price increase in the years immediately preceding 2021 resulted in our NEOs holding a larger value of unvested equity awards as of the start of 2021.\n\n## Relationship Between Compensation Actually Paid and Net Income\n\nNet Income is generally a key indicator of company profitability and for Apple can contribute to changes in our stock price, which in turn drives Compensation Actually Paid. We do not use Net Income as a financial measure in our executive compensation program but Operating Income from which Net Income is derived. Operating Income and Net Sales are the two financial performance measures for our Cash Incentive Plan.\n\n## Relationship Between Compensation Actually Paid and Net Sales\n\nNet Sales is one of the two financial measures, the People and Compensation Committee has set for our Cash Incentive Plan, and therefore along with Operating Income is the next most important financial metric in determining Compensation Actually Paid behind Relative TSR. Strong performance in Net Sales and Operating Income led to above target bonus payouts in 2021, 2022, and 2023 which in turn increased Compensation Actually Paid.\n\n## Tabular List of Apple's most important metrics that link Compensation Actually Paid to the Mr. Cook and other NEOs\n\nFor 2023, the following list represented the most important financial performance measures used by Apple to link Compensation Actually Paid with our financial performance:"}
