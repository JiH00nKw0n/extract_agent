In determining the appropriate amount of each compensation component for 2023, the People and Compensation Committee considered numerous factors with the Board and its independent compensation consultant, including Mr. Cook's outstanding leadership, the immense scope and complexity of his role as Apple's CEO, the Board's confidence in his long-term strategic decisions, the Company's financial results delivered during 2022, and shareholder feedback. Balancing this feedback, Apple's exceptional performance, a desire to continue to create meaningful performance and retention incentives, and a recommendation from Mr. Cook to adjust his compensation in light of the feedback received, the People and Compensation Committee reduced his 2023 target equity award value while increasing the portion of performance-based RSUs granted to Mr. Cook from 50% to 75%. Given Apple's significantly larger size and scope, as compared to its primary peer companies, as well as Mr. Cook's history of delivering exceptional results, the People and Compensation Committee also intends to position his future total target compensation, commensurate with these factors, between the 80th and 90th percentiles of CEO total target compensation in our primary peer group.\n\nTim Cook Chief Executive Officer Role: 12 years Apple Tenure: 25 years\n\n## 2023 Total Target Compensation: $49 million\n\nBase Salary: $3 million Mr. Cook's base salary has remained the same since 2016\n\nCash Incentive Plan Opportunity: $6 million Mr. Cook's target Cash Incentive Plan opportunity for 2023 remained at 200% of his base salary\n\nTarget Equity Award Value: $40 million Award Mix: 75/25\n\nMr. Cook was granted an equity award with 75% of the equity award subject to performance-based vesting and 25% of the equity award subject to time-based vesting\n\n## CEO Equity Awards\n\nEquity awards granted to Mr. Cook are intended to create meaningful equity incentives aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders. The People and Compensation Committee recognizes the growth and success Mr. Cook has delivered to shareholders for more than a decade as CEO, and the impact of his leadership is evident in the Company's short-term and long-term success. The amount and structure of Mr. Cook's equity awards are intended to align with our philosophy of managing Apple for the long term and create incentives to drive continued success."}

Net sales and operating income continue to reflect commonly recognized key measures of overall company performance and profitability and are drivers of shareholder value creation.\n\nPayouts for our named executive officers under the Cash Incentive Plan are first determined quantitatively based on an equal weighting of the net sales and operating income performance measures. The target payout opportunity for each of the net sales and operating income performance measures is 100% of annual base salary for our named executive officers. Threshold performance results in a payout equal to 50% of target and maximum performance results in a payout equal to 200% of target for each of the performance measures. If the threshold goal is not achieved for a financial performance measure, there is no payout for that measure and the total payout opportunity for each financial performance measure is capped at 200%. Payouts for our named executive officers are linearly interpolated for achievement between goal levels.\n\nThe People and Compensation Committee primarily considers factors relevant to the current fiscal year when it sets the net sales and operating income goals for the annual Cash Incentive Plan awards because each year presents a unique set of challenges and business conditions for our executives to navigate.

To earn the target number of performance-based RSUs, Apple must achieve above-median performance at the 55th percentile of the S&P 500. We measure Relative TSR for the applicable performance period based on the change in each company's stock price during the applicable performance period, taking into account any dividends paid during that period, which are assumed to be reinvested in the stock.

This averaging period mitigates the impact on the long-term Relative TSR results of one-day or short-term stock price fluctuations at the beginning or end of the performance period.

The People and Compensation Committee also approved a retirement vesting provision in Mr. Cook's outstanding equity awards to recognize the unique impact of his leadership decisions on the long-term growth and success of Apple. Retirement is defined as a termination of employment after reaching at least 60 years of age and completing at least 10 years of service with Apple. Mr. Cook has met these requirements. The People and Compensation Committee considered shareholder feedback provided in recent engagements that the primary purpose of time-based RSUs should be retention. Thus, while treatment in the event of death or disability remained unchanged, Mr. Cook's 2023 time-based RSUs were structured to vest on a pro rata basis, based on the dates of employment, in the event of his termination due to retirement on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. Unless otherwise determined by the People and Compensation Committee, Mr. Cook's outstanding performance-based RSU agreements provide for a continued right to receive the full number of earned shares underlying the performance-based RSUs on the original vesting dates upon a termination due to death, disability, or termination of employment due to retirement that occurs on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. If Mr. Cook retires on or after the first anniversary of the grant date, the shares underlying his RSU awards will be released on the original vesting date, subject to the attainment of the performance goals for the performance-based RSUs. The delivery of the vested shares underlying Mr. Cook's equity awards and any dividend equivalents that have accrued on such awards are not accelerated upon retirement.\n\n# Governance and Other Considerations"}

We also use Relative TSR as the key performance measure for our performance-based RSUs. Over the three-year period covered in this disclosure, Apple's TSR on an absolute basis was high, 55.24%, and outperformed the TSR of our primary peer group by 16.88% Apple's Relative TSR measured against the members of the S&P 500 Index (the peer group for performance-based RSUs) was also strong, resulting in above-target payouts for the performance-based RSUs with applicable performance periods ending in 2021, 2022, and 2023. Further, the TSR relative to the currently outstanding performance-based RSUs (granted in 2022 and 2023) continues to trend towards above-target payouts due to strong TSR relative to the members of the S&P 500. This shows how Compensation Actually Paid to our NEOs and TSR are tightly linked.\n\nThe 2021 Compensation Actually Paid values for the CEO and NEOs are higher than the Summary Compensation Table totals in 2021, and higher than the Compensation Actually Paid values in 2022 and 2023 because Apple's significant and outstanding stock price increase in the years immediately preceding 2021 resulted in our NEOs holding a larger value of unvested equity awards as of the start of 2021.\n\n## Relationship Between Compensation Actually Paid and Net Income\n\nNet Income is generally a key indicator of company profitability and for Apple can contribute to changes in our stock price, which in turn drives Compensation Actually Paid. We do not use Net Income as a financial measure in our executive compensation program but Operating Income from which Net Income is derived. Operating Income and Net Sales are the two financial performance measures for our Cash Incentive Plan.\n\n## Relationship Between Compensation Actually Paid and Net Sales\n\nNet Sales is one of the two financial measures, the People and Compensation Committee has set for our Cash Incentive Plan, and therefore along with Operating Income is the next most important financial metric in determining Compensation Actually Paid behind Relative TSR. Strong performance in Net Sales and Operating Income led to above target bonus payouts in 2021, 2022, and 2023 which in turn increased Compensation Actually Paid.\n\n## Tabular List of Apple's most important metrics that link Compensation Actually Paid to the Mr. Cook and other NEOs\n\nFor 2023, the following list represented the most important financial performance measures used by Apple to link Compensation Actually Paid with our financial performance:"}
