Given Apple's significantly larger size and scope, as compared to its primary peer companies, as well as Mr. Cook's history of delivering exceptional results, the People and Compensation Committee also intends to position his future total target compensation, commensurate with these factors, between the 80th and 90th percentiles of CEO total target compensation in our primary peer group.\n\nTim Cook Chief Executive Officer Role: 12 years Apple Tenure: 25 years\n\n## 2023 Total Target Compensation: $49 million\n\nBase Salary: $3 million Mr. Cook's base salary has remained the same since 2016\n\nCash Incentive Plan Opportunity: $6 million Mr. Cook's target Cash Incentive Plan opportunity for 2023 remained at 200% of his base salary\n\nTarget Equity Award Value: $40 million Award Mix: 75/25\n\nMr. Cook was granted an equity award with 75% of the equity award subject to performance-based vesting and 25% of the equity award subject to time-based vesting\n\n## CEO Equity Awards\n\nEquity awards granted to Mr. Cook are intended to create meaningful equity incentives aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders.

These factors included anticipated foreign currency headwinds, the ongoing uneven macroeconomic environment and the continuing effects of the prolonged uncertainty caused by the COVID- 19 pandemic including, country-specific policies and lockdowns. Accordingly, the People and Compensation Committee determined that focusing on the underlying business performance was an appropriate method of evaluating the 2023 performance goals. The Committee believed that attaining similar underlying performance to 2022's record-breaking net sales and operating income results would require a high level of performance given these factors, and set the target goals at this level.\n\nFor 2023, the Company's total net sales decreased 3%. However, the weakness in foreign exchange relative to the US dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales. On an underlying basis, the company delivered strong performance in a challenging environment driven by all-time high revenue records in emerging markets, and we achieved an all-time revenue record in Services. The Company was also thoughtful and deliberate on spending while driving cost and gross margins improvements throughout the year. Overall, we reported net sales of $383.3 billion and operating income of $114.3 billion.

To earn the target number of performance-based RSUs, Apple must achieve above-median performance at the 55th percentile of the S&P 500.

This averaging period mitigates the impact on the long-term Relative TSR results of one-day or short-term stock price fluctuations at the beginning or end of the performance period. For each company, the change in stock price from the beginning to the end of the performance period is divided by the beginning stock price to determine TSR.\n\nThe performance-based RSUs granted on September 25, 2022, have a three-fiscal-year performance period from the beginning of 2023 through the end of 2025.

The compensation paid to our executive officers in 2023 aligns with the continued strength of our financial results in an uneven macroeconomic environment and the significant progress made across our core values and key community initiatives. We encourage shareholders to read the section entitled \"Compensation Discussion and Analysis, beginning on page 46, which describes the details of our executive compensation program and the People and Compensation Committee's decision-making process with respect to our executive compensation program.\n\n89% of votes cast on the Say on Pay advisory proposal at the 2023 Annual Meeting were in favor of our executive compensation program. This result reflects the expanded shareholder engagement efforts, and the positive shareholder response to the overall structure of our executive compensation program and the changes to Mr. Cook's 2023 total target compensation.\n\nShareholders are being asked to approve the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:\n\nRESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the SEC's executive compensation disclosure rules, which disclosure includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and the narrative disclosures that accompany the executive compensation tables, is hereby approved.\n\nAs an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding on Apple, the Board, or the People and Compensation Committee. However, the People and Compensation Committee and the Board value the opinions expressed by shareholders in their votes on this proposal and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions regarding named executive officers.\n\nWe expect the next advisory Say on Pay vote will occur at the 2025 annual meeting of shareholders.\n\nThe Board recommends a vote FOR Proposal No. 3\n\n## Vote Required\n\nApproval of Proposal No. 3 requires the affirmative vote of (i) a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting and (ii) a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.\n\nSummary Governance Directors Compensation Proposals Other Information"}
