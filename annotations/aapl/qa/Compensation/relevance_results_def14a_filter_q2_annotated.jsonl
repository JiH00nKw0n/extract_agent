Behind every innovation, there are so many talented teams who collaborate to create incredible products and services for Apple users around the world. And following the expansion of our charter in 2023, the People and Compensation Committee will do even more to support Apple's teams - including oversight of our investments in employee engagement, inclusion and diversity, talent recruitment, development, and retention.\n\nOf course, Apple's leadership plays a key role in fostering a culture of collaboration - driving innovation and charting a course for the future. Our executive compensation program aims to reflect these important contributions, from leaders whose vision is so essential to Apple's continued success. It also reflects feedback from our shareholders - which is an important consideration every year as we evaluate the compensation of our executive officers.\n\nThat includes our Chief Executive Officer - Tim Cook - whose outstanding leadership has been crucial to Apple's success and its enduring track record of innovation. Tim continues to distinguish himself as a responsible, thoughtful, and visionary leader guiding Apple. Under his leadership, the company continues to empower people with innovative technology, while staying true to the values and the spirit of ingenuity that have long guided its work, and over the past three years, Apple's total shareholder return is more than 55% - nearly 20% above the S&P 500.\n\nAs a committee, we have a responsibility to ensure that the compensation of our CEO reflects the success of our Company and the excellence of its leadership. Last year, our committee shared its intention to set Tim's compensation between the 80th and 90th percentiles of target CEO pay at our primary peer companies, and 89% of votes cast on the Say on Pay proposal at the 2023 Annual Meeting were in favor of Apple's executive compensation program. We believe positioning Tim's compensation at this level is responsive to shareholder feedback and appropriate given Apple's relative size and scope compared to our peer companies."}

Each named executive officer other than Mr. Cook was granted a long-term equity award on September 25, 2022 of 50% performance-based and 50% time-based RSUs. Mr. Cook was granted a long-term equity award on September 25, 2022 of 75% performance-based and 25% time-based RSUs.\n\n## 2023 Time-Based RSUs\n\nEquity awards with time-based vesting align the interests of our named executive officers with the interests of our shareholders by promoting the stability and retention of a high-performing executive team over the longer term. Vesting schedules for time-based RSUs are generally longer than our peer companies.\n\nTime-based RSUs granted to our named executive officers on September 25, 2022, will vest in three equal annual installments over approximately four and one-half years, with the first installment vesting on April 1, 2025 (approximately two and one-half years following the grant date), subject to the award agreements. The number of time-based RSUs granted to each named executive officer was determined by dividing the target value of $10 million by the closing stock price on the date of grant. The grant date fair value for these RSUs is reported in the \"Summary Compensation Table- 2023, 2022, and 2021.\"\n\n## 2023 Performance-Based RSUs\n\nThe People and Compensation Committee continued to use Relative TSR as the metric for performance-based RSUs with the S&P 500 as the comparative group because it continues to be an objective and meaningful metric to evaluate our performance against the performance of other large companies and aligns the interests of our named executive officers with the interests of our shareholders in creating long-term value."}

As a result, 100% of the time-based RSUs granted to Mr. Cook in 2021 and 2022 RSUs were considered \"vested\". A pro rata portion of Mr. Cook's 2023 time-based RSUs are considered \"vested\" consistent with the retirement provisions of that award. No other NEOs, other than Mr. Cook, have retirement provisions in their equity awards. The fair values of the RSUs included in the compensation actually paid to our CEO and the average compensation actually paid to our other NEOs are calculated at the required measurement dates, consistent with the approach used to value the awards at the grant date as described above in footnote 1 to the \"Summary Compensation Table - 2023, 2022, and 2021\" and footnote 1 to the \"Grants of Plan-Based Awards - 2023\" table, respectively. Any changes to the time-based RSU and performance-based RSU grant date fair values (for 2023 grants) and from prior year-end (for 2021 and 2022 grants) are based on an updated stock price valuation on the measurement dates and for the performance-based RSUs, including updated input variables for the Monte-Carlo model to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance objectives established for the respective award.\n\n(3) The dollar amounts in column (d) represent the average amounts of compensation reported for the other NEOs for each corresponding year in the \"Total\" column of the \"Summary Compensation Table - 2023, 2022, and 2021\" as set forth on page 62 of this proxy statement.
