Approximately half of Americans live and work in a jurisdiction with no legal protections if their employer takes action against them for their political activities.\n\nCompanies with inclusive policies are better able to recruit the most talented employees from a broad labor pool, resolve complaints internally to avoid costly litigation or reputational damage, and minimize employee turnover. Moreover, inclusive policies contribute to more efficient human capital management by eliminating the need to maintain different policies in different locations.\n\nThere is ample evidence that individuals with conservative viewpoints may face discrimination at Apple."}

Additionally, in developing Face ID, Apple appreciated from the outset that facial recognition algorithms had been associated with divergent error rates across demographic groups and so worked with volunteer participants from around the world to include a representative group of people accounting for gender, age, ethnicity, disability, and other factors.

(3) Similarly, in 2017 Apple removed the New York Times's apps from the App Store in China in 2017, (4) and removed apps including HKmap.live and Quartz from its offerings, during the protests in Hong Kong in 2019.
