We are therefore greatly concerned at recent reports of Apple arbitrarily limiting content access within its online services, as detailed below. This censorship endangers Apple's trust with its users and jeopardizes Apple's stated commitments to human lightsandproviding quality products.Shareholders must know that Applewill meaningfully commit to protecting reliable app access as a crucial aspect of both good social policy and respecting its users' civil liberties.\n\nApple has defended the connection between human rights and technological access in its Commitment to Human Rights (1) further asserting its primary emphasis on maintaining users' \"access to reliable information and helpful technology.\" Yet, recent actions call the veracity of such commitments into question.\n\nApple has been characterized by the 1792 Exchange as \"leverag[ing] its corporate reputation and funds to support. groups hostile to freedom of expression,\" most recently the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Reporting indicates Apple's removal of popular Quran (2) (Quran Majeed) and Bible (3) (Olive Tree) reading apps from its App Store in China, at the request of authorities within the CCP. Furthermore, as detailed in the 2022 edition of the Viewpoint Diversity Index (4) Apple does not provide a clear standard as to what apps are and not allowed on its platforms, indicating a concerning absence of protocol to determine what content is permissible (5) further amplified by recent concerns over Apple's threat to remove Twitter (X) from its App Store (6) a seemingly political swipe that conservative lawmakers have characterized as a \"raw exercise of monopolistic power.\" (7) These actions conflict with Apple's stated Commitment to Human Rights and the interest of millions of Apple's users in reliably accessing content. Furthermore, the perception that Apple does not respect the civil liberties of its users and vendors creates significant reputational risk and risk of political backlash, threatening shareholder value.\n\n(1) https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_downloads/gov_docs/2020/Apple-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf\n\n(2) htps://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58921230\n\n(3) https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-takes-down-quran-bible-jehovahs-witenss-apps-in-china-2021-\n\n(4) htps://www.viewpointdiversityscore.org/business-index\n\n(5) https://1792exchange.com/pdf/?c_id=667\n\n(6) https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/28/tech/elon-musk-twitter-apple-app-store/index.html)"}

This proposal addresses our use of artificial intelligence across our \"business operations.\" The proposal does not focus on any specific novel use of AI at Apple and, in fact, references well-established applications of software such as automation of systems. Broadly defined, the requested report could encompass every aspect of our business, including whether and how we use automated systems in, for example, product development and research, supply chain management, financial management and planning, efficient management of energy use throughout our physical plant and buildings, monitoring of cyber and physical security at our facilities, coordinating employee benefit or other personnel programs, and conducting a wide range of other aspects of our business operations.\n\nBeyond our business operations, due to its broad nature, the requested report would cover virtually every product and service Apple currently offers. To cite a few examples, SiriTM, which has been available for more than a decade, Personal Voice and Live Voicemail included in iOS 17, and life saving features like Fall Detection, Crash Detection, and ECG, would simply not be possible without the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The broad scope of the proposal therefore speaks against preparing the report requested, especially as the proponent does not point to any specific use of AI at Apple that raises concerns. Not only would the report encompass every aspect of our operations and nearly every product or service we build, it could also cover competitively harmful disclosure of confidential research and development activities.\n\nThe AI regulatory landscape is rapidly evolving. Apple has been and will continue to be deliberate and thoughtful in the development and deployment of artificial intelligence. However, this proposal is premature in asking for a dedicated report when the landscape is just starting to emerge and regulators around the world are actively engaged in new rulemaking.\n\n(4) apple.com/diversity/\n\n(5) apple.com/privacy/\n\n(6) apple.com/legal/privacy\n\n(7) apple.com/legal/privacy/data/"}
