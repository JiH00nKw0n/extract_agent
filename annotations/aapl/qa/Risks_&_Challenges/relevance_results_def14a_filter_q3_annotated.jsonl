We're required to comply with local laws, and at times there are complex issues about which we may disagree with governments \"\n\nWhile any freedom-loving individual would likely admire such principles, Apple appears to implement - or rescind - them inconsistently across countries where it conducts business, and incongruently with its principles.\n\nFor example in China, the Company severely restricted use of its AirDrop wireless filesharing feature on users' iPhones during protests against Chairman Xi Jinping's \"zero COVID\" policies in late 2022. (3) Similarly, in 2017 Apple removed the New York Times's apps from the App Store in China in 2017, (4) and removed apps including HKmap.live and Quartz from its offerings, during the protests in Hong Kong in 2019. (5)\n\nYet upon the invasion into Ukraine, the Company halted the sale of all its products in Russia and stopped exports into the country. (6) \"We are deeply concerned about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and stand with all of the people who are suffering as a result of the violence,\" said an Apple spokesman. As a result, Apple stood to lose as much as $1.14 billion (U.S.) annually in iPhone sales alone, and the decision removed access to Apple's critical communications and services for victims of the war. (7)\n\nConsidering these examples, it appears the Company's principles to \"empower and connect people\" as \"a force for good\" - while remaining \"engaged\" even where it disagrees with a government and its laws, by still making its products \"available\" to users - has its limits.\n\nResolved: Shareholders request the Board of Directors issue a report by March 31,2025, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary or confidential information, analyzing the congruency of the Company's privacy and human rights policy positions with its actions, especially in such places as war zones and under oppressive regimes, as they impact how the Company maintains its reputation, viability and profitability.\n\n(1) htps://www.apple.com/privacy/govemment-information-requests/\n\n- (2)https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_downloads/gov_docs/2020/Apple-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf"}
