The guiding principle of the App Store is simple - we want to provide a safe experience for users to get apps and a great opportunity for all developers to be successful. We do this by offering a highly curated App Store where apps are reviewed by specialists, and an editorial team helps users discover new apps every day. And we disclose the standards and procedures that we apply in reviewing apps in our publicly available App Store Review Guidelines. (2)\n\nTo fulfill our goals for the App Store, trained experts from our App Review team review every app and app update for compliance with the App Review Guidelines, a process outlined in our Digital Services Act Transparency Report. (3) The App Store review process is carried out by hundreds of human App Review specialists, representing 81 languages across three time zones. All App Review specialists charged with continuing review of apps published on the App Store receive comprehensive training when they join the App Review team. This training is supplemented by ongoing training so that specialists remain informed of new and emerging threats and issues. App Review specialists also receive language- and region-specific training that covers cultural and sensitivity issues as they relate to enforcing the App Store Review Guidelines. Difficult decisions are escalated to Apple's Executive Review Board, composed of senior leaders who have ultimate decision-making responsibility regarding the App Store, including app takedowns, further engagement, or an exploration of viable alternatives, as appropriate.\n\nAs part of the review process, Apple works hard to prevent illegal content from ending up on a country's storefront. Apple seeks to abide by the laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, as all companies operating in such jurisdictions must do. Whenever possible, apps that are removed from the App Store will only be removed in countries and territories specific to the issue, and will remain available in locations that aren't impacted. If a developer believes their app should be reinstated on the App Store, they can appeal the removal.\n\n(1) investor.apple.com/Apple-Human-Rights-Policy\n\n(2) developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/\n\n(3) apple.com/legal/dsa/transparency/eu/app-store/2310/", "label": "O"}

Black workers' hourly median earnings represent 81 percent of white wages. The median income for women working full time is 83 percent that of men. Intersecting race, Black women earn 64 percent, Native women 51 percent, and Latina women 54 percent. At the current rate, women will not reach pay equity until 2059, Black women until 2130, and Latina women until 2224. (1)\n\nCitigroup estimates closing minority and gender wage gaps 20 years ago could have generated 12 trillion dollars in additional income. PwC estimates closing the gender pay gap could boost Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries' economies by 2 trillion dollars annually. (2)\n\nActively managing pay equity is associated with improved representation, and diversity is linked to superior stock performance and return on equity.

(1) The policy governs how we treat everyone, including people at every level of our supply chain, as well as our customers, our employees, and our business partners. We are deeply committed to respecting internationally recognized human rights in our business operations, as set out in the United Nations International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Moreover, our approach is guided by the United Nations' Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and reflects feedback that we have heard from our shareholders, as well as civil and human rights organizations and other stakeholders. Our commitment to human rights extends to every facet of our business, from working to safeguard security and user privacy in our products and promoting freedom of expression and access to information on our platforms to providing a safe and respectful environment for all people in our supply chain.\n\nIn July 2023, we published our Civil Rights Assessment report prepared by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and his team at Covington & Burling LLP. The report reviews Apple's extensive efforts to respect civil rights and to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion and live by its core values, including accessibility, inclusion and diversity, and privacy. These efforts, many of which began years ago, are reflected in Apple's current policies and practices, which are detailed in Covington's report.\n\nWe are transparent about our approach to complex situations and commitment to engagement.
