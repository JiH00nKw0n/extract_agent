And then maybe for you and Tim, you guys have been on the leading edge of innovation across hardware, software, silicon services. And I'm sure there's plenty of technologies and kind of longer-term projects that you're investing in. How should we think about your capital intensity as we look to fiscal year '24, just given over the last few years, CapEx as a percentage of revenue has been relatively low compared to the 8 years prior?\n\nSo should we expect a step up or kind of similar capital intensity? And what are the more notable moving pieces, if any, that we should be thinking about?"}

Actually, Tim, the last question is a perfect segue here, given what you are doing with your Vision Pro. So lots of companies are experimenting with generative AI. I'm curious about what kind of efforts you have. I'm sure there are segways into Pro Vision (sic) [ Vision Pro ] that you have. But I was curious about if you can give us a glimpse on how you might be able to monetize some of these efforts with generative AI."}

And so just recently, when we shipped iOS 17, it had features like Personal Voice and Live Voicemail. AI is at the heart of these features. And then you can go all the way to then life-saving features on the Watch and the phone like fall detection, crash detection, ECG on the watch. These would not be possible without AI.\n\nAnd so we don't label them as such, if you will. We label them as to what their consumer benefit is, but the fundamental technology behind it is AI and machine learning. In terms of generative AI, we have -- obviously, we have work going on. I'm not going to get into details about what it is because as you know, we really don't do that. But you can bet that we're investing, we're investing quite a bit. We are going to do it responsibly. And it will -- you will see product advancements over time where those technologies are at the heart of them."}

It's a number of things, Richard. It's the -- some things I can't talk about. It's Vision Pro. It's AI and ML. It's the silicon investment that we're making, the transition with the Mac and other silicon. It's sort of all of those things. But I think you would find that the R&D expenditure in the aggregate looks very competitive versus others."}
