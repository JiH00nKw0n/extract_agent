It's why we work every day to make our technology an even greater force for good. Today, our teams around the world work to infuse Apple's deeply held values into everything we make. That work can take many forms. But whether we're protecting the right to privacy, designing technology that is accessible to all, or using more recycled materials in our products than ever, we are always working to make a difference for the people we serve and the planet we inhabit.\n\nApple has a robust approach to addressing ethical considerations across our business operations and that addresses the issues raised in the proposal. We believe it's important to be deliberate and thoughtful in the development and deployment of artificial intelligence, and that companies think through the consequences of new technology before releasing it - something we've always been deeply committed to at Apple. Social issues raised in the proposal, like discrimination, bias, and privacy may be implicated by Al technologies, but are not unique to the application of Al. Accordingly, our existing guidelines, policies, and procedures already address the social issues raised, as described below.\n\nOur approach to human rights: In all of our work, Apple's values are a driving force. We're deeply committed to respecting internationally recognized human rights in our business operations, (1) and align our efforts with the business and human rights due diligence process set forth in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. As part of our processes, we conduct due diligence to identify risks and work to mitigate them. This includes identification of salient human rights risks across our organization through internal risk assessments and external industry-level third-party audits, as well as through communication channels maintained with rights holders and other stakeholders."}
