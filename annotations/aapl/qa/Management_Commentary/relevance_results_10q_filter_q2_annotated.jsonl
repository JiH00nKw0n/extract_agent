Year-over-year Products gross margin percentage decreased during the first nine months of 2023 due primarily to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix.\n\nServices Gross Margin\n\nServices gross margin increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs.\n\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022 due primarily to higher Services costs, partially offset by improved leverage. Year-over-year Services gross margin percentage decreased during the first nine months of 2023 due primarily to higher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by improved leverage.\n\nThe Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure.\n\nApple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 17"}
