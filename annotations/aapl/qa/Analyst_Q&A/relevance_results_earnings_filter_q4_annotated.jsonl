If you look at how we did in Greater China for the quarter, we came in at, on revenue basis, minus 2. But one thing to keep in mind here is that the FX impact was nearly 6 points. So we grew in constant currency. And underneath that, if you look at the different -- the categories, iPhone actually set a September quarter record in Mainland China.\n\nAnd the -- what pulled down the performance was a combination largely of Mac and iPad. Services also grew during the quarter. And the Mac and iPad suffered from the same issues that the company did with the compare issues to factory disruptions in Q3 that were filled subsequently in Q4 of '22. In addition to that, we had the top 4 selling phones in urban China for last year. And I was -- I just -- I took a trip over there and could not be more excited about the interactions I had with customers and employees and others."}
