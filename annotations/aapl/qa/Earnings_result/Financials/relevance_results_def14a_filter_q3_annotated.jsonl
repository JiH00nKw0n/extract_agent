These factors included anticipated foreign currency headwinds, the ongoing uneven macroeconomic environment and the continuing effects of the prolonged uncertainty caused by the COVID- 19 pandemic including, country-specific policies and lockdowns. Accordingly, the People and Compensation Committee determined that focusing on the underlying business performance was an appropriate method of evaluating the 2023 performance goals. The Committee believed that attaining similar underlying performance to 2022's record-breaking net sales and operating income results would require a high level of performance given these factors, and set the target goals at this level.\n\nFor 2023, the Company's total net sales decreased 3%. However, the weakness in foreign exchange relative to the US dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales. On an underlying basis, the company delivered strong performance in a challenging environment driven by all-time high revenue records in emerging markets, and we achieved an all-time revenue record in Services. The Company was also thoughtful and deliberate on spending while driving cost and gross margins improvements throughout the year. Overall, we reported net sales of $383.3 billion and operating income of $114.3 billion. These achievements resulted in 153.1% and 179.1% target payout opportunities, respectively, for an aggregate payout opportunity of 166.1% prior to application of the modifier described below."}
