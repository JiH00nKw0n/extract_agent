The Netflix leadership team and the Company navigated challenges while demonstrating tireless dedication to executing our long-term strategy. This past year, we stayed focused on reaccelerating growth by continuing to release films, series and games that are loved by our members; addressed account sharing in all jurisdictions; and improved our advertising offering for both consumers and advertisers. We also broadened our entertainment offerings with live events and deepened our connection with fans through consumer products and live experiences.\n\nWe continued to create and deliver world-class entertainment across a variety of genres and languages, demonstrating that great stories come from anywhere and are enjoyed by audiences everywhere. Over the last year we expanded the Bridgerton universe with Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, released action-packed films, such as The Mother starring Jennifer Lopez and Extraction 2 with Chris Hemsworth, and brought back the French TV drama Lupin for its third season, all breaking the top 10 for most popular TV series and films in English and Non-English.\n\nAt the end of 2023, we had over 260 million paid memberships, achieved approximately $33.7 billion in revenue, representing approximately 7% year-over-year growth, and over $6.9 billion of operating income, as well as increased our net cash provided by operating activities to approximately $7.3 billion.\n\nIn January of 2023, as part of the Board's ongoing succession planning and evolution of the management team, Greg Peters was appointed to serve as the co-Chief Executive Officer\n\nalongside Ted Sarandos, and to serve on the Board, after Reed Hastings stepped down from his role as co-Chief Executive Officer and President. In our first year under new management, we believe this leadership model that combines Ted and Greg's complementary skill sets has proven to be effective.\n\nThis past year, the Board, alongside management, continued to actively engage with shareholders to seek their input and provide perspective on our policies and practices. In response, we adopted significant changes to our executive compensation program for our executive officers, Ted, Greg, Reed, Spencer Neumann and David Hyman, which took effect in 2024. As a continued evolution of our corporate governance structure and practices, the Board adopted corporate governance guidelines that includes a framework for director commitments. More details of these and other changes are provided in this Proxy Statement. The Board appreciates the shareholder feedback, which will continue to inform the Board's regular review of our corporate governance practices.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, we thank you for your investment.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nJoy Hoag\n\nJay C.

As part of the chief executive officer succession plan, we adopted a co-Chief Executive Officer structure in 2020, when Ted Sarandos was named co-CEO along with Reed Hastings. This change mostly formalized the prior working relationship between Ted and Reed. In January 2023, Reed stepped down as co-CEO and President of the Company. He continues to serve as the Executive Chairman. Greg Peters was promoted to serve as co-CEO alongside Ted. Greg was also appointed to the Board. The three of them have worked together for over 15 years and have had a long history of collaboration on corporate strategy, planning and all aspects of company management. We believe the co-CEO structure has been effective and continues to provide broad expertise and deep leadership at the highest level of the Company.

Shareholders inquired about\n\nthe co-CEO model following Reed's transition to Executive Chairman. We explained the working relationship between Ted and Greg, and that it was an effective leadership model to further support our continued growth and strategic initiatives.

The Board oversees the Company's ESG efforts, which include human capital management, inclusion, diversity, sustainability (including climate strategy) and other matters. The Board also oversees succession planning.

Stockholders will have an opportunity to cast an advisory vote on the frequency of say-on-pay votes at least every six years. We currently expect that the next advisory vote on the frequency of the say-on-pay votes will occur at the 2029 annual meeting of stockholders.\n\nWe encourage stockholders to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement for an overview of our executive compensation philosophy and program, which is designed to attract and retain outstanding performers. Our compensation practices are guided by market rates and tailored to account for the specific needs and responsibilities of the particular position, as well as the performance and unique qualifications of the individual employee, rather than by seniority or overall Company performance.\n\nThe Compensation Discussion and Analysis also describes a number of changes that took effect for the 2024 executive compensation program, which were adopted in response to the 2023 say-on-pay vote and shareholder engagement. These changes include: (1) eliminating the ability to allocate compensation between cash salary and stock options for our Executive Officers; (2) limiting guaranteed cash compensation by setting base salary at $3 million for the co-CEOs, $100,000 for our Executive Chairman, and $1.5 million for the other Executive Officers; (3) expanding participation in the annual performance- based cash bonus program to all Executive Officers; (4) granting performance-based restricted stock unit awards and time- based restricted stock unit awards with expanded vesting terms to our Executive Officers instead of stock options for long term equity compensation; (5) evolving our change-in-control severance arrangements to include \"double-trigger\" provisions for Executive Officers; and (6) adopting stock ownership guidelines for our Executive Officers.\n\nThe Compensation Committee believes these changes to our compensation structure are in line with peer companies' compensation practices, help attract and retain top talent to support our growth, incentivize our Named Executive Officers to execute on strategies aimed at achieving long-term success and align with stockholder interests. At the time of the 2023 say-on-pay vote, the Compensation Committee had already approved the design of our 2023 executive compensation program. As such, all changes to the executive compensation program are for 2024, and we encourage stockholders to consider these changes in reviewing the say-on-pay proposal.\n\n## Required Vote\n\nThe affirmative vote of the majority of the shares present or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal is required to approve the compensation of our Named Executive Officers disclosed in this Proxy Statement.

The Compensation Committee maintained 2024 base salaries at $3 million for the co-CEOs, reduced base salary to $100,000 for the Executive Chairman, and introduced $1.5 million base salaries for the other Executive Officers. As a result of these changes, base salary was reduced by approximately 79% for Mr. Neumann, approximately 63% for Mr. Hyman, and 80% for Mr. Hastings compared to 2023. Base salaries remained flat for Messrs. Sarandos and Peters compared to 2023.\n\n- Expanded Participation in the Annual Bonus Program to all Executive Officers: The Compensation Committee expanded participation in the annual performance-based cash bonus program (the \"Bonus Program\") under the Company's Amended and Restated Performance Bonus Plan (the \"Bonus Plan\") to all Executive Officers with target bonus opportunities at 200% of base salary for 2024. The Bonus Program aims to align pay with performance by awarding cash bonuses only upon the achievement of defined performance targets. The Compensation Committee believes this aligns our Executive Officers' compensation with the Company's financial performance and the interests of our shareholders.\n\n- For the 2024 Bonus Program, the Compensation Committee used the following performance metrics: F/X Neutral Revenue and F/X Neutral Operating Margin, as these represent key performance indicators that are directly impacted by Executive Officers' decision-making. The Compensation Committee increased the weighting of the F/X Neutral Operating Margin metric to 65% from the previous 50% in 2023 to emphasize the importance of F/X Neutral Operating Margin to our overall business strategy as margin improvement is key to our Company performance and enhancing shareholder value. F/X Neutral Revenue was reduced to a weighting of 35%. The target bonus opportunity was decreased to 200% of salary from a higher opportunity offered to our co-CEOs in 2023 because we introduced RSU and PSU awards, which have longer vesting or performance periods, and is in line with the goal of incentivizing alignment with long-term interest of our shareholders and value creation. The Compensation Committee set targets at levels it considered to be appropriately rigorous for the year, including requiring growth in revenue compared to the prior year. Additional information regarding the 2024 Bonus Program and the specific targets they were measured against will be included in our proxy statement for our 2025 annual shareholders' meeting. These changes represent an approximately 50% reduction in target cash compensation opportunities (in the form of base salary and target bonus opportunity) year-over-year for the co-CEOs.\n\n- Introduced PSU and RSU Awards: Historically, we granted fully-vested stock options to our Named Executive Officers, except the stock options granted to our co-CEOs and Executive Chairman as part of their 2023 compensation package had a one-year vesting period.

Executive Officers, excluding the co-CEOs.\n\nIn determining total target compensation for our Executive Officers for 2024 compared with 2023, in consultation with Compensia, the Compensation Committee considered our compensation philosophy detailed below, including comparative market data.\n\nFor Mr. Sarandos, the Compensation Committee considered the competitive market compensation paid by other similarly- situated companies and determined to keep Mr. Sarandos' total target compensation flat as compared to 2023.\n\nFor Mr. Peters, the Compensation Committee considered the competitive market compensation paid by other similarly-situated companies, his increasing duties and scope of responsibilities and performance as a co-CEO, and his total target compensation was increased from $34,650,000 to $40,000,000.\n\nFor Mr. Hastings, the Compensation Committee considered the evolving role and responsibilities of the Executive Chairman position and decreased his total target compensation from $3,000,000 to $1,000,000.\n\nFor Mr. Neumann, the Compensation Committee considered the competitive market compensation paid by other similarly- situated companies and his experience in leading a financial organization in the media industry, as well as the increasing complexity of our financial reporting, and his total target compensation was increased from $14,000,000 to $15,000,000.\n\nFor Mr. Hyman, the Compensation Committee acknowledged his performance in managing and developing a global legal and public policy function. After reviewing the competitive market compensation paid by other similarly-situated companies, the Compensation Committee determined to keep Mr. Hyman's 2024 target compensation flat as compared to 2023.\n\nActual compensation that an executive may earn may be more or less than total target compensation depending on Company performance. If the Company does not meet target performance, an executive may earn less than the target bonus or no bonus at all, and if the Company outperforms, an executive may earn more. Similarly, PSU awards will vest only upon the achievement of performance targets over the relevant performance period, so unless the Company meets performance targets, an executive will not receive any vests of PSU awards. RSU awards also vest over a three-year period even though the full grant date fair value of the award will be reflected in 2024 compensation in the Summary Compensation Table. The total target compensation amounts may also be different from the amounts to be reported in the Summary Compensation Table based on actual performance and the accounting valuation of the equity awards.\n\n## Our Company and 2023 Performance\n\nNetflix is one of the world's leading entertainment services with over 260 million paid memberships in over 190 countries.

We adopted a salary cap of $3 million for our co-CEOs. Our other Named Executive Officers were eligible to allocate the proportion of cash and equity compensation.\n\n- Stock Options. We believe that equity ownership, including stock and stock options, helps align the interest of our Named Executive Officers with those of our shareholders and links executive compensation to long-term Company performance. In 2023, we required our co-CEOs and our Executive Chairman to allocate at least 50% of their allocatable compensation to stock options.\n\n- Stock options for a given compensation year are granted beginning in February and through January of the next calendar year. We granted stock options on the first trading day of each month with the number of options granted based on the closing stock price on that trading day (see formula below). Granting options monthly produces a dollar cost averaging effect, which we believe has helped reduce the potential negative impacts with employee distraction and morale. The number of monthly stock options granted was determined by the following formula:\n\n\t(the amount of an employee's total annual stock option allocation/12)\n\n\t(the closing trading price of a share of our stock on the grant date X 0.40)\n\nOur option grant formula requires 40% stock price appreciation from the date of grant before an executive breaks even with the foregone cash compensation. In practice, our methodology serves as de facto vesting criteria because it requires meaningful performance improvement before it is worthwhile to exercise the options.

The prior version of Section 162(m) generally disallowed a tax deduction for compensation that we paid to our Chief Executive Officer or any of the next three most highly compensated executive officers (excluding the Chief Financial Officer) to the extent that the compensation for any such individual exceeded $1 million in any taxable year. However, this deduction limitation did not apply to compensation that was \"performance-based\" under Section 162(m). The Tax Act amended Section 162(m) to eliminate the exception for performance- based compensation. As a result, effective for our 2018 fiscal year and thereafter, the maximum U.S. federal income tax deduction that we may receive for annual compensation paid to any individual who is a \"covered employee\" under Section 162(m) is $1 million per covered employee.\n\nThe Tax Act also expanded the list of individuals who are \"covered employees\" under Section 162(m), which now includes the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, the three most highly compensated officers and any former covered employee for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016. For tax years beginning on and after December 31, 2026, the list of \"covered employees\" will be further expanded to include five additional highly compensated employees.\n\nWe continued to grant stock options in 2023, although the compensation income recognized upon exercise of such grants by covered employees under Section 162(m) will not be deductible by us to the extent the total compensation for each covered employee exceeds $1 million in the year in which the stock options are exercised.

Sarandos and Peters. The pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.\n\nAs disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table, the 2023 annual total compensation as determined under Item 402 of Regulation S-K was $49,834,936 for Mr. Sarandos. As permitted by Item 402(u), Mr. Peters' 2023 compensation was annualized to represent his compensation as if he were co-CEO for the entire 2023 fiscal year. Mr. Peters' annual total compensation as determined in accordance with Item 402(u) was $40,945,350 for 2023. The calculation included the amounts reported in the Summary Compensation Table, except that the salary and stock option allocation were adjusted to assume Mr. Peters received his co-CEO salary and stock option allocation for the entire fiscal year. Consequently, the annual total compensation reported for CEO pay ratio purposes for Mr. Peters does not reflect Mr. Peters' \"Total\" column for 2023 of our Summary Compensation Table included in this proxy statement, nor does it reflect amounts actually paid to Mr. Peters for fiscal year 2023. Instead, the annual total compensation reported for Mr. Peters above reflects a permissible approach under Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K for calculating CEO pay for a year in which a CEO transition occurs. The 2023 annual total compensation as determined under Item 402 of Regulation S-K for our median employee was $200,761. Based on the foregoing, our estimate of the ratio of our co-CEOs' annual total compensation to our median employee's annual total compensation for fiscal year 2023 is 248 to 1, in the case of Mr. Sarandos, and 204 to 1, in the case of Mr. Peters.

Consistent with the Summary Compensation Table, we examined total annual compensation for all employees (excluding Messrs. Sarandos and Peters), which included: base salary, option awards consisting of stock options, and other compensation such as 401(k) matching contributions. We annualized the compensation of all permanent full-time and part-time employees who were not employed by us for all of 2023.

(\"Company\") hereby request that the board of directors take the necessary action to adopt a director election resignation bylaw that requires each director nominee to submit an irrevocable conditional resignation to the Company to be effective upon the director's failure to receive the required shareholder majority vote support in an uncontested election. The proposed resignation bylaw shall require the Board to accept a tendered resignation absent the finding of a compelling reason or reasons to not accept the resignation. Further, if the Board does not accept a tendered resignation and the director remains as a \"holdover\" director, the resignation bylaw shall stipulate that should a \"holdover\" director fail to be re-elected at the next annual election of directors, that director's new tendered resignation will be automatically effective 30 days after the certification of the election vote. The Board shall report the reasons for its actions to accept or reject a tendered resignation in a Form 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nSupporting Statement: The Proposal requests that the Board establish a director resignation bylaw to enhance director accountability. The Company has established in its bylaws a majority vote standard for use in an uncontested director election, an election in which the number of nominees equal the number of open board seats. Under applicable state corporate law, a director's term extends until his or her successor is elected and qualified, or until he or she resigns or is removed from office. Therefore, an incumbent director who fails to receive the required vote for election under a majority vote standard continues to serve as a \"holdover\" director until the next annual meeting. A Company governance policy currently addresses the continued status of an incumbent director who fails to be re-elected by requiring such director to tender his or her resignation for Board consideration.\n\nThe new director resignation bylaw will set a more demanding standard of review for addressing director resignations then [sic] that contained in the Company's resignation governance policy. The resignation bylaw will require the reviewing directors to articulate a compelling reason or reasons for not accepting a tendered resignation and allowing an unelected director to continue to serve as a \"holdover\" director. Importantly, if a director's resignation is not accepted and he or she continues as a \"holdover\" director but again fails to be elected at the next annual meeting of shareholders, that director's new tendered resignation will be automatically effective 30 days following the election vote certification. While providing the Board latitude to accept or not accept the initial resignation of an incumbent director that fails to receive majority vote support, the amended bylaw will establish the shareholder vote as the final word when a continuing \"holdover\" director is not re-elected. The Proposal's enhancement of the director resignation process will establish shareholder voting in director elections as a more consequential governance right.\n\n# Proposal 6: Stockholder Proposal - Director Election Resignation Bylaw Proposal\n\n## Netflix Opposing Statement\n\nThis Proposal 6 requests that the Company adopt a director election resignation bylaw that requires each director nominee to submit an irrevocable conditional resignation to the Company to be effective upon the director's failure to receive the required shareholder majority vote support in an uncontested election.

The Company has established in its bylaws a majority vote standard for use in an uncontested director election, an election in which the number of nominees equal the number of open board seats. Under applicable state corporate law, a director's term extends until his or her successor is elected and qualified, or until he or she resigns or is removed from office. Therefore, an incumbent director who fails to receive the required vote for election under a majority vote standard continues to serve as a \"holdover\" director until the next annual meeting. A Company governance policy currently addresses the continued status of an incumbent director who fails to be re-elected by requiring such director to tender his or her resignation for Board consideration."}, {"type": "Text", "bbox": {"left": 0.0727124183006536, "top": 0.547979797979798, "width": 0.8521241830065359, "height": 0.13446969696969696, "page": 90}, "content": "The new director resignation bylaw will set a more demanding standard of review for addressing director resignations then [sic] that contained in the Company's resignation governance policy.

Importantly, if a director's resignation is not accepted and he or she continues as a \"holdover\" director but again fails to be elected at the next annual meeting of shareholders, that director's new tendered resignation will be automatically effective 30 days following the election vote certification.

Our current director resignation policy requires an incumbent director who does not receive the requisite affirmative majority of the votes cast for their re-election in an uncontested election to promptly tender their resignation to the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee then makes a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board then acts on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Nominating and Governance Committee's recommendation. We acknowledge and agree with transparency regarding board resignations, and our existing director resignation policy requires public disclosure (by a press release, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) of the decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind such decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results.\n\nA policy that requires automatic resignations of directors who do not receive majority support and resignations of \"holdover\" directors to be automatically effective in 30 days may have unintended consequences and presents the risk of losing a director who provides valuable skills and insights to Netflix at a critical time. In this regard, it could also leave vacancies in important board seats. Rather than making resignations automatically effective, the Board believes it is important to be able to accept or reject such resignation after thoughtful deliberation and taking into account any factors or information it believes are appropriate and relevant, consistent with the Board's fiduciary duties under Delaware law. Not all of these factors may be known to our shareholders. These factors also include any alternatives to address and cure the underlying reasons reasonably believed to have resulted in the director's failure to receive the necessary votes for re-election. Making resignations automatically effective, absent a \"compelling reason\" is therefore overly prescriptive and may impermissibly limit the Board's decision-making authority and exercise of its fiduciary duties. It is unclear how a \"compelling reason\" standard would apply under Delaware law.\n\nOur current director resignation policy is consistent with those of the majority of S&P 500 companies, which are not automatically effective. Adopting the policy requested by the Proposal would place us as an outlier among our peers and the majority of public companies, and could place us at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Board unanimously recommends that you vote \"AGAINST\" Proposal 6.\n\n## Required Vote\n\nThe affirmative vote of the majority of the shares present or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal is required to approve the stockholder proposal.

The Netflix Code of Ethics (the \"Code\") was revised in 2023 and will be periodically reviewed and updated as necessary. The Code already contains strong anti-discrimination, anti-harassment and whistleblower protections of the type described in the Proposal. The Code, which applies to directors as well as all employees and officers of the Company, specifically notes that \"[w]e do not tolerate harassment or discrimination of any kind.\" The Code further states, \"Netflix will not allow retaliation in any form, including for reporting any improper conduct.\" Netflix does not tolerate harassment of employees or anyone involved with our Company. This point is also underscored in the Company's Culture Memo (\"We are strict about ethical and safety issues. We have no tolerance for harassment of employees or trading on insider information, for example.\") This also aligns with the values and approach to anti-harassment and anti-discrimination set forth in our Commitment to Respect policy. All employees have the ability to raise complaints internally or externally. We encourage employees to bring any concerns or grievances they may have to any member of management or their human resources partner. We also have a third-party confidential reporting system that any employee, cast, crew, or vendor can use to anonymously report unethical conduct or breaches of applicable laws, rules and regulations, including issues of alleged harassment, discrimination, whistleblower complaints, bullying, and retaliation, without fear of retaliation. All issues and suggestions are responded to and tracked to closure.\n\nNetflix also seeks to maintain a company culture that is not only free from discrimination, harassment and retaliation, but is as diverse as the communities we serve, where people of all backgrounds have an equal opportunity to contribute at their highest levels without exclusion and bias. We already publish annually an inclusion update, which provides a snapshot of representation within the Company, our progress to date and areas we are focused on for the future and other information on our inclusion efforts in our ESG Report. In addition, we conduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid based on gender (globally) and race (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to rectify pay gaps that we find through this analysis. As the Proposal acknowledges, we maintain a remarkable track record regarding representation, visibility, and empowerment for underrepresented groups in our productions.\n\nNetflix already considers ethics and diversity in assessing director qualifications. As part of the director selection process, the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board consider a range of candidate qualifications, expertise and characteristics that we believe contribute to an effective Board, including personal and professional ethics as well as diversity. Diversity includes diversity of viewpoint, professional experience, education, international experience, skill, and other individual qualities and attributes that contribute to board heterogeneity, including characteristics such as race, gender, and national origin. We strive to maintain a diverse Board with complementary skills, experience, and expertise. Additionally, we expect our directors to act ethically and abide by the Code, and as described above, we have various channels to raise complaints if there are any concerns regarding unethical behavior.

More than 100 companies do not attach strings to their 25% threshold. However Netflix attached a big string to its current threshold by excluding all shares that are not held for a full continuous year. Thus to make up for the exclusion of all shares held for less than a full continuous year the new threshold at Netflix should reasonably be set at 15%.\n\nSince a special shareholder meeting can be useful in replacing a director, this proposal may be an incentive for Netflix directors to improve their performance and in turn improve Netflix shareholder value. For instance Mathias D\u00f6pfner and Jay Hoag, with excessive 25-years tenure, each received more than 60 million against votes. This compares to the other 2 directors on the 2023 ballot receiving less than 13 million against votes each.\n\nCalling a special shareholder meeting is hardly ever used by shareholders but the main point of the right to call a special shareholder meeting is that it gives Netflix shareholders a Plan B option if management is not interested in good faith shareholder engagement. Management would have an incentive to genuinely engage with shareholders as an alternative to conducting a special shareholder meeting.\n\nWith the widespread use of online shareholder meetings it is much easier for management to conduct a special shareholder meeting and thus Netflix bylaws need to be updated accordingly.\n\nPlease vote yes:\n\nSpecial Shareholder Meeting Improvement-Proposal 8", "blocks": [{"type": "Title", "bbox": {"left": 0.21405228758169934, "top": 0.18876262626262627, "width": 0.6372549019607843, "height": 0.2077020202020202, "page": 95}, "content": "STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL:\nSpecial\nShareholder\nMeeting\nImprovement"}, {"type": "Text", "bbox": {"left": 0.0727124183006536, "top": 0.11300505050505051, "width": 0.8259803921568627, "height": 0.058712121212121215, "page": 96}, "content": "In accordance with SEC rules, we have set forth below a stockholder proposal, along with the supporting statement of the stockholder proponent, for which we and our Board accept no responsibility.

Only Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, the co-CEOs on December 31, 2023 participated in the Performance Bonus Program in 2023. F/X Neutral Revenue was calculated assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period. F/X Neutral Operating Margin was calculated by dividing Adjusted Operating Profit by Adjusted Revenue.
