In the opinion of management, the financial information for the quarters and three quarters ended July 2, 2023 and July 3, 2022 reflects all adjustments and accruals, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods. In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“10-Q”), Starbucks Corporation is referred to as “Starbucks,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our.”\n\nSegment information is prepared on the same basis that our management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes.\n\nThe financial information as of October 2, 2022 is derived from our audited consolidated financial statements and notes for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022 (“fiscal 2022”) included in Item 8 in the Fiscal 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K (“10-K”). The information included in this 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the footnotes and management’s discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements in the 10-K.\n\nThe results of operations for the quarter and three quarters ended July 2, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be achieved for the entire fiscal year ending October 1, 2023 (“fiscal 2023”).\n\nThe novel coronavirus, known as the global COVID-19 pandemic, was first identified in December 2019 before spreading to markets where we have company-operated or licensed stores. We have since established the necessary protocols to operate safely, and in many of our markets, our businesses demonstrated powerful momentum beyond recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. During the quarter ended July 2, 2023, our China market continued its recovery from pandemic-related business interruptions in previous quarters that had suppressed customer mobility. We continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on our business and results of operations; however, we cannot predict the duration, scope or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or its future impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nRestructuring\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we announced our plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience (the “Reinvention Plan”). We believe the company-operated market investments in partner wages and trainings have increased retention and productivity while the acceleration of purpose-built store concepts and innovations in technologies will provide additional convenience and connection with our customers. As a result of the restructuring efforts in connection with the Reinvention Plan, we recorded an immaterial charge on our consolidated statements of earnings during the quarter and three quarters ended July 2, 2023. Future restructuring and impairment costs attributable to our Reinvention Plan are not expected to be material.\n\nAs of July 2, 2023 and October 2, 2022, there were no material restructuring-related accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance related to reference rate reform. The pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burden related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and generally can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2024. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\n\nNote 2: Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Alliance\n\nFiscal 2023\n\nOn January 13, 2023, we sold the assets, primarily consisting of intellectual properties associated with the Seattle's Best Coffee brand, to Nestlé for $110.0 million. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $91.3 million, which was included in gain from sale of assets on our consolidated statements of earnings. Results from Seattle's Best Coffee operations prior to the sale are reported in our Channel Development operating segment.\n\n10"}

A portion of our price-to-be-fixed contracts are effectively fixed through the use of futures. See Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, for further discussion. Price-to-be-fixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore the price, at which the base “C” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. For most contracts, either Starbucks or the seller has the option to “fix” the base “C” coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date. For other contracts, Starbucks and the seller may agree upon pricing parameters determined by the base “C” coffee commodity price. Until prices are fixed, we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments. We believe, based on established relationships with our suppliers and continuous monitoring, the risk of non-delivery on these purchase commitments is remote.\n\nNote 6: Supplemental Balance Sheet and Statement of Earnings Information (in millions):\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, net"}

As of July 2, 2023, Starbucks had more than 37,200 company-operated and licensed stores, an increase of 7% from the prior year. Additionally, we sell a variety of consumer-packaged goods, primarily through the Global Coffee Alliance established with Nestlé and other partnerships and joint ventures.\n\nWe have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada, 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other.\n\nWe believe our financial results and long-term growth model will continue to be driven by new store openings, comparable store sales growth and operating margin management, underpinned by disciplined capital allocation. We believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. Throughout this MD&A, we commonly discuss the following key operating metrics:\n\n•New store openings and store count\n\n•Comparable store sales growth\n\n•Operating margin\n\nComparable store sales growth represents the percentage change in sales in one period from the same prior year period for company-operated stores open for 13 months or longer and exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. We analyze comparable store sales growth on a constant currency basis as this helps identify underlying business trends, without distortion from the effects of currency movements. Stores that are temporarily closed or operating at reduced hours due to the COVID-19 pandemic remain in comparable store sales while stores identified for permanent closure have been removed.\n\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. Fiscal 2023 and 2022 include 52 weeks. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of store closures, unless otherwise noted.\n\nStarbucks results for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 demonstrate the overall strength of our brand. Consolidated net revenues increased 12% to $9.2 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $8.2 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily driven by strength in our U.S. business and international licensed markets as well as continued recovery from COVID-19 pandemic-related business interruptions in China. During the quarter ended July 2, 2023, our global comparable store sales grew 10%, primarily driven by 7% growth in the U.S. market and 24% growth internationally, demonstrating the strength of the Starbucks brand globally. Consolidated operating margin increased 140 basis points from the prior year to 17.3%, primarily driven by sales leverage, pricing and productivity improvement from increased efficiency in our U.S. stores. These were partially offset by previously-committed investments in labor, including enhancements in retail store partner wages and benefits as well as increased general and administrative costs related to our Reinvention Plan.\n\nResults of Operations (in millions)\n\nRevenues"}
