The Governance Principles provide that our Compensation Committee has general oversight responsibility for management development and succession planning practices and strategy. Our Compensation Committee, pursuant to its charter, annually reviews and discusses with the independent directors of the board the performance of certain senior officers of the Company and the succession plans for each such officer's position including\n\n28\n\nrecommendations and evaluations of potential successors to fill these positions. The Compensation Committee also conducts a periodic review of, and provides approval for, our management development and succession planning practices and strategies, including the review and oversight of risks and exposures associated with the succession planning practices and strategies.\n\n## ceo Succession Planning\n\nAs discussed in the board's recommendation on Proposal 6 Regarding ceo Succession Planning Policy Amendment, which is set forth on page 77, the board recently amended the Governance Principles to expand on ceo succession planning. A primary responsibility of the board is planning for ceo succession The chair of our Nominating/Governance Committee, together with the chair of the board (or, if the chair of the board is not independent, the lead independent director), the chair of the Compensation Committee, and the ceo (collectively, the \"succession planning team\") will annually evaluate and update as appropriate the skills, experience, and attributes that the board believes are important to be an effective ceo in light of our business strategy. The succession planning team will also annually review with the board, our ceo succession planning process, including the identification, development, and progress of internal candidates and how candidates have been assessed. Chief executive officer succession planning should be an ongoing process, with the goal of providing sufficient lead time before an expected transition while also being prepared for and responsive to unexpected developments.\n\n## Oversight of ESG\n\nOur board is highly engaged in ESG matters given that our global social impact, sustainability goals, and human capital are intricately linked to our strategic direction. Our board considers these matters at least annually in connection with the strategic plan. In addition, except where explicitly delegated to other board committees or retained by the board, our Nominating/Governance Committee is tasked with the responsibility of overseeing the effectiveness of our environmental, social, and corporate governance strategies, policies, practices, goals, and programs, including review of our annual Global Environmental and Social Impact Report. Further, our Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of human capital development plans and succession planning practices to foster sufficient management depth at the Company to support its continued growth and the talent needed to execute long-term strategies, while our Audit Committee is tasked with overseeing the Company's risk management, including with respect to certain ESG topics.\n\n## Board\n\nOur board is responsible for ensuring ESG risks and opportunities are integrated into Starbucks long-term strategy.\n\n## Nominating/Governance Committee\n\nOversees, reviews, and assesses the effectiveness of Starbucks ESG strategies, policies, practices, goals, and programs; annually reviews Starbucks corporate political contributions and expenditures to ensure alignment with Starbucks policies and values.\n\n## Compensation Committee\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nOversees certain ESG risks, as\npart of overall risk management,\nand also reviews ESG\ndisclosures in SEC filings.\n\nOversees the development,\nimplementation, and effectiveness of\nStarbucks practices, policies, and\nstrategies relating to human capital\nmanagement as they relate to Starbucks\nworkforce generally."}

In contrast, the nondairy milk market, including oat, coconut, soy, and almond milks, is projected to grow from over $25 billion in 2022 to over $61 billion by 2029. Three major factors are driving the demand for nondairy milk: taste, lactose intolerance, and environmental concerns\n\nResearch shows that 82% of people who consume plant-based milk do so because they prefer the taste.\n\nWhile many people prefer nondairy milk over cow's milk, other individuals can't tolerate cow's milk at all: 95% of Asian, 80 to 100% of Native American, 60 to 80% of Black, and 50 to 80% of Latinx populations suffer from lactose intolerance Nonwhites currently comprise nearly 40% of the U.S. population, and that segment is growing, which means that increasing numbers of Americans may hesitate to visit Starbucks or order drinks that include milk because of our current upcharge on nondairy milk.\n\nApproximately 56% of surveyed individuals who choose nondairy milk do so because of environmental concerns. Starbucks has publicly disclosed that dairy milk is the biggest contributor to our company's carbon footprint and the second-highest contributor to water usage. Cattle, including dairy COWS, account for roughly 40% of all greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture; plant-based milks produce less than one-third of CO2 emissions It takes 144 gallons of water to produce just 1 gallon of dairy milk; nondairy milks require up to 90% less water.\n\nStarbucks has committed to increasing plant-based options as a way of investing in an environmentally friendly menu. It is reasonable for shareholders to request an analysis of the potential costs to our company of the current upcharge on nondairy milk with regard to public relations and lost sales. Accordingly, we urge all shareholders to support this resolution."}

Our aim is to provide our customers with a variety of food and beverage choices in addition to sustainable dairy, and we have collaborated with plant-based innovators so that today nearly all stores across our markets offer plant-based food and beverage menu items. We continue to introduce new drinks and food items to menus while innovating with plant-based ingredients across key platforms like espresso, cold brew, refreshers, and food to meet growing customer demand globally.

We began offering plant-based milk to customers in the U.S. in 1997 when we added soymilk to menus As non-dairy beverages grew in popularity, we added coconut milk in 2015, almond milk in 2016, and expanded to offer oat milk nationally in 2021.

In April 2022, former CEO Kevin Johnson retired and Howard Schultz returned as Interim CEO while the Board searched for a permanent replacement. In explaining Starbucks' external search, Schultz told a reporter, \"For the future of the company, we need a domain of experience and expertise in a number of disciplines that we don't have now.\" While there may be circumstances where an external candidate is the best choice, not having any viable internal candidates is evidence of the Board's weak succession planning.\n\nReportedly, the Board was notified of Johnson's pending retirement at least one year in advance. Poor succession planning resulted in Starbucks losing a critical component of a smooth transition: business continuity. Rather than Johnson playing a large role in the onboarding of a successor, Laxman Narasimhan spent months shadowing Schultz who was retired for five years before his recent return. Adding to the bumpy transition, Schultz launched a \"Reinvention Plan\" that included changes to Starbucks strategy and leadership structure prior to Narasimhan's start.²\n\nAn effective succession planning process includes the regular evaluation of skills and competencies needed in a successor, identification of promising internal candidates, and a talent development strategy. A dynamic policy would better equip Starbucks for an emergency or planned succession with capable internal candidates and a candidate profile to expedite an external search. Developing a robust leadership pipeline has a myriad of benefits including retained institutional knowledge and increased employee morale and retention. The current policy is lacking, and we fear the Board is overly reliant on Schultz, as this was his second return.\n\nResearch suggests that poorly planned successions and external successors negatively impact financial performance. A 2006 study found that delays in hiring a successor and recruiting externally decreased subsequent financial performance. Research published in the Harvard Business Review in 2021 suggests that CEOs hired internally could perform better than external hires 61% of the time.4 A 2001 study found that hiring externally following a CEO retirement precipitated a nearly 6% drop in performance. Given these risks, Starbucks would benefit from a robust succession planning policy that produces viable internal candidates going forward.\n\n- 1 https://www.wsj.com/articles/howard-schultz-says-starbucks-is-seeking-fresh-blood-in-ceo-search-11654488060\n\n- 2 htps://www.restaurantdive.com/news/Starbucks-eliminates-COO-role/630060/;https:/investor.starbucks.com/press-releases/financial-releases/press-release-details/2022/Starbucks-Enters\new-Era-of-Growth-Driven-by-an-Unparalleled-Reinvention-Plan/default.aspx\n\n- 3 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287508898_Deaths_of_CEOs_Are_delays_in_naming_successors_and_insideroutsider_succession_associated_with_subsequent_firm_performan\n\n4 ps://hbr.org/2021/05/the-high-cost-of-poor-succession-planning\n\n- 5 https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/leadership-the-performance-impact-of-new-ceos/\n\n## BOARD RECOMMENDATION\n\nThe Starbucks board of directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons:\n\nOur Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our board of directors reviewed proponent's proposal and directed our general counsel and our corporate secretary to propose revisions to our Corporate Governance Principles and Practices for the Board of Directors (our \"Governance Principles\") that would consider suggestions made in the proposal.

See, e.g., \"Doing business in China is difficult. A clash over human rights is making it harder,\" April 2. 2021,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/02/business/nike-china-western-business-intJ-hnk/index.html.\n\nStarbucks has 5,400 stores in over 200 cities across China, and relies on raw materials, finished products, labor and/or services from entities in the communist nation. China is an established serial violator of human and political rights.\n\n- China is also a hostile adversary of the U.S. for many reasons, including:\n\n- China intends to displace the U.S. as the lone global superpower by 2049;\n\n- The U.S. has committed to defend Taiwan, which China has militaristically asserted is part of its country and may attempt to seize by force:\n\n- U.S.-China relations are tense over a number of issues including China's military expansion; egregious human rights violations; actions related to the COVID pandemic; intellectual property theft; relentless espionage; elimination of freedom in Hong Kong; and environmental pollution.\n\nChina has also indicated that it would use its industrial capabilities for strategic purposes against adversaries.\n\nMany Chinese companies which are ultimately under the control of the Communist government-are vulnerable to the U.S. Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, do not adhere to basic auditing standards, and are therefore untrustworthy.\n\nChina and by extension the companies it controls is also identified in the U.S. State Department's 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report as a state sponsor of human trafficking. It is now subject to the Uyghur Forced labor Prevention Act, which imposes strict verification of parts and products imported from China, that they are not generated from slave labor.\n\nStarbucks's extensive ties to China breed reputational risk for the company also. For example, while the company funds groups that promote the interests of homosexual and transgender individuals, the Communist government persistently and vigorously cracks down on those forms of identity within its borders.\n\nA July 2022 joint statement from the leaders of the British and American domestic intelligence agencies warned that the Communist Chinese Party is the greatest threat to the international order. \"We consistently see that it's the Chinese government that poses the biggest long-term threat to our economic and national security, and by our,' I mean both of our nations, along with our allies in Europe and elsewhere,\" said FBI Director Christopher Wray.\n\nGiven the controversial, if not dangerous, nature of doing business in and with China, shareholders have the right to know the extent to which Starbucks Corporation's business operations\n\ndepend on Communist China."}
