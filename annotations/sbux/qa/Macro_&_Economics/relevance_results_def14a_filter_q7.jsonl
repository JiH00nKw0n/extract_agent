We are meeting them where they are, whether that's a Cold Brew on the go from a Pick-Up store, a quiet moment with a cappuccino inside one of our cafés, or a deep-dive into coffee education with a workshop at our new Starbucks Reserve location at the Empire State Building.

We take this responsibility seriously and strive to make a positive difference in the lives of the people we serve and the planet we share. We believe that every partner and every customer should have a sense of belonging at Starbucks, and should be able to be their authentic selves every day. We are dedicated to advancing racial and social equity, and we are committed to furthering that work with intention, transparency, and accountability. We are striving to be a resource-positive company, to give back more of the planet's resources than we consume. To help us get there, we have clear and ambitious sustainability targets to reduce our carbon, water, and waste footprints in half by 2030. Additionally, we are integrating sustainability throughout our Reinvention efforts, working to ensure we are considering the impacts to sustainability with each one of our strategies.\n\n## Onward\n\nThe new fiscal year also marks a new chapter with incoming ceo, Laxman Narasimhan. Since joining the company in October, he has been traveling around the world and immersing in our company and culture.

Johnson as president and chief executive officer, and the appointment of Starbucks founder, Howard Schultz, as interim chief executive officer in April 2022. Our board of directors selected Mr. Schultz based on his role in building Starbucks into one of the world's most recognized and respected businesses, a company focused on delivering best-in-class financial performance, through exceeding the expectations of our people and our customers Under his leadership, Starbucks grew from 11 stores with 100 partners to more than 28,000 stores in 77 countries, and he pioneered programs like comprehensive healthcare, stock ownership, and free college tuition for full and part-time partners.\n\nAdditional leadership and organizational changes followed in fiscal 2022, which concluded with the appointment of Laxman Narasimhan, as chief executive officer-elect in October 2022. Mr. Narasimhan is expected to be appointed as our permanent chief executive officer in April 2023. Mr. Narasimhan brings nearly 30 years of experience leading and advising global consumer- facing brands. Known for his considerable operational expertise, he has a proven track record in developing purpose-led brands, and building on companies histories, he has succeeded in rallying talent to deliver on future ambitions by driving consumer-centric and digital innovations.\n\nGuided by Mr. Schultz and our partners, in fiscal 2022, we began to implement our Reinvention Plan, an inspired roadmap to build the future of Starbucks, while staying true to our mission of uplifting communities through a shared love for coffee and further extending our coffee leadership and innovation. Starbucks partners are at the core of the Reinvention Plan, and we are committed to investing in our partner base through recruiting, training, and onboarding initiatives. As part of the Reinvention Plan, we also are continuing to unlock the intersection of convenience and connection by introducing enhancements to the customer experience across the retail and digital realms. Finally, we are seeking to continue to accelerate our leadership position in international markets through the strength of our licensing model, the digital Starbucks Experience and purpose-driven growth in China.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we continued to manage the business through global economic uncertainties, inflationary pressures, a resurgence of COVID-19 in China, and lower government subsidies. In fiscal 2022, we grew global revenues 13%* year-over-year to a record $32.3 billion, driven by 8% comparable stores sales growth globally and 12% comparable stores sales growth in North America as we saw meaningful growth in our global customer base. In the U.S., we grew our unique customers 9% year-over-year, and we saw a 16%* increase in U.S. Starbucks Rewards membership year-over-year to nearly 29 million members. However, international comparable store sales decreased 9%, primarily attributable to COVID-19 related restrictions in China, and our operating income and operating margin for the International segment decreased, driven primarily by lower sales related to COVID-19 restrictions in China, investments in our partners, and lower government subsidies."}
