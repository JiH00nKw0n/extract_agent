This is a place where on either side of the well-worn wood counters, visitors and baristas converse like old friends and celebrate the craft and care that goes into every cup of Starbucks coffee. There's an enduring energy and spirit in the air that inspires us and reminds us of the extraordinary journey Starbucks has traveled over five decades.\n\nWe've grown from just four stores to nearly 36,000; from serving a few hundred customers a day to now more than 100 million customer occasions daily around the world.\n\nAt the heart of it all is the Starbucks secret sauce - our people and their ability to create magic through coffee and connection"}

This also includes aspects of our sustainability initiatives and social impact agenda that relate to our strategy. The board's oversight of risk is another integral component of the board's oversight and engagement on strategic matters. Strategy-related matters are regularly discussed at board meetings and, when relevant, at committee meetings. We also dedicate at least one board meeting every year to an even more intensive review and discussion of the Company's strategic plan. Matters of strategy also inform committee-level discussions of many issues, including business risk. Engagement of the board on these issues and other matters of strategic importance continues in between meetings, including through updates to the board on significant items and discussions by the ceo with the independent chair of the board on a periodic basis. Each director is expected to and does bring to bear their own talents, insights, and experiences to these strategy discussions.\n\n## BEYOND THE BOARDROOM\n\nIn order to increase each director's engagement with and understanding of our strategy, each director participates in an extensive orientation program upon joining the board, including meeting with members of our executive leadership team and other key leaders of the Company to gain a deeper understanding of Starbucks businesses and operations, attending cultural immersion programs, and visiting our stores to engage with store partners and customers first-hand. Periodic briefing sessions are also provided to members of the board on subjects that would assist them in discharging their duties. Our directors also have the opportunity through our periodic investor day presentations to understand and assess how we are communicating our strategy to our investors and other important stakeholders.\n\n26\n\n# Risk Oversight\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nThe board of directors has overall responsibility for risk oversight. A fundamental part of risk oversight is not only understanding the material risks a company faces and the steps management is taking to manage those risks, but also understanding what level of risk is appropriate for that company. The involvement of the board in reviewing Starbucks business strategy is an integral aspect of the board's assessment of management's tolerance for risk and also its determination of what constitutes an appropriate level of risk for the Company.\n\nWhile the full board has overall responsibility for risk oversight, the board has delegated oversight responsibility related to certain risks to the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating/Governance Committee.\n\nin\n\n:-"}

This process is enterprise-wide for managers up to and including our ceo.\n\nOur board's involvement in our annual succession planning process is outlined in our Governance Principles. The Governance Principles provide that our Compensation Committee has general oversight responsibility for management development and succession planning practices and strategy. Our Compensation Committee, pursuant to its charter, annually reviews and discusses with the independent directors of the board the performance of certain senior officers of the Company and the succession plans for each such officer's position including\n\n28\n\nrecommendations and evaluations of potential successors to fill these positions. The Compensation Committee also conducts a periodic review of, and provides approval for, our management development and succession planning practices and strategies, including the review and oversight of risks and exposures associated with the succession planning practices and strategies.\n\n## ceo Succession Planning\n\nAs discussed in the board's recommendation on Proposal 6 Regarding ceo Succession Planning Policy Amendment, which is set forth on page 77, the board recently amended the Governance Principles to expand on ceo succession planning. A primary responsibility of the board is planning for ceo succession The chair of our Nominating/Governance Committee, together with the chair of the board (or, if the chair of the board is not independent, the lead independent director), the chair of the Compensation Committee, and the ceo (collectively, the \"succession planning team\") will annually evaluate and update as appropriate the skills, experience, and attributes that the board believes are important to be an effective ceo in light of our business strategy. The succession planning team will also annually review with the board, our ceo succession planning process, including the identification, development, and progress of internal candidates and how candidates have been assessed. Chief executive officer succession planning should be an ongoing process, with the goal of providing sufficient lead time before an expected transition while also being prepared for and responsive to unexpected developments.\n\n## Oversight of ESG\n\nOur board is highly engaged in ESG matters given that our global social impact, sustainability goals, and human capital are intricately linked to our strategic direction. Our board considers these matters at least annually in connection with the strategic plan. In addition, except where explicitly delegated to other board committees or retained by the board, our Nominating/Governance Committee is tasked with the responsibility of overseeing the effectiveness of our environmental, social, and corporate governance strategies, policies, practices, goals, and programs, including review of our annual Global Environmental and Social Impact Report. Further, our Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of human capital development plans and succession planning practices to foster sufficient management depth at the Company to support its continued growth and the talent needed to execute long-term strategies, while our Audit Committee is tasked with overseeing the Company's risk management, including with respect to certain ESG topics.\n\n## Board\n\nOur board is responsible for ensuring ESG risks and opportunities are integrated into Starbucks long-term strategy.\n\n## Nominating/Governance Committee\n\nOversees, reviews, and assesses the effectiveness of Starbucks ESG strategies, policies, practices, goals, and programs; annually reviews Starbucks corporate political contributions and expenditures to ensure alignment with Starbucks policies and values.\n\n## Compensation Committee\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nOversees certain ESG risks, as\npart of overall risk management,\nand also reviews ESG\ndisclosures in SEC filings.\n\nOversees the development,\nimplementation, and effectiveness of\nStarbucks practices, policies, and\nstrategies relating to human capital\nmanagement as they relate to Starbucks\nworkforce generally."}

Based upon this review, management and the Compensation Committee concluded that our compensation practices and policies do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company, and Pay Governance supported this conclusion.

China is an established serial violator of human and political rights.\n\n- China is also a hostile adversary of the U.S. for many reasons, including:\n\n- China intends to displace the U.S. as the lone global superpower by 2049;\n\n- The U.S. has committed to defend Taiwan, which China has militaristically asserted is part of its country and may attempt to seize by force:\n\n- U.S.-China relations are tense over a number of issues including China's military expansion; egregious human rights violations; actions related to the COVID pandemic; intellectual property theft; relentless espionage; elimination of freedom in Hong Kong; and environmental pollution.\n\nChina has also indicated that it would use its industrial capabilities for strategic purposes against adversaries.\n\nMany Chinese companies which are ultimately under the control of the Communist government-are vulnerable to the U.S. Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, do not adhere to basic auditing standards, and are therefore untrustworthy.\n\nChina and by extension the companies it controls is also identified in the U.S. State Department's 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report as a state sponsor of human trafficking. It is now subject to the Uyghur Forced labor Prevention Act, which imposes strict verification of parts and products imported from China, that they are not generated from slave labor.\n\nStarbucks's extensive ties to China breed reputational risk for the company also. For example, while the company funds groups that promote the interests of homosexual and transgender individuals, the Communist government persistently and vigorously cracks down on those forms of identity within its borders.\n\nA July 2022 joint statement from the leaders of the British and American domestic intelligence agencies warned that the Communist Chinese Party is the greatest threat to the international order. \"We consistently see that it's the Chinese government that poses the biggest long-term threat to our economic and national security, and by our,' I mean both of our nations, along with our allies in Europe and elsewhere,\" said FBI Director Christopher Wray.\n\nGiven the controversial, if not dangerous, nature of doing business in and with China, shareholders have the right to know the extent to which Starbucks Corporation's business operations\n\ndepend on Communist China."}

According to the International Labour Organization, \"Freedom of association refers to the right of workers to create and join organizations of their choice freely and without fear of reprisal or interference\" and collective bargaining \"allows workers to negotiate their working conditions freely with their employers.\"\n\nIn the U.S., many workers allege that Starbucks has interfered with these rights, including retaliation, intimidation, firings, captive audience meetings, store closings, undue surveillance, and illegally excluding unionized employees from wage and benefit increases-generating negative media coverage. Workers at hundreds of stores have voted to unionize, and regional offices of the National Labor Relations Board, after finding merit to hundreds of allegations of labor rights violations, have issued at least 20 complaints against Starbucks.2\n\nIn August 2022, a U.S. judge ordered Starbucks to reinstate seven Memphis, Tennessee employees who were allegedly fired for supporting an organizing campaign. 3 Also in August, the labor board requested that Howard Schultz read a notice to all employees informing them that some had been unlawfully denied benefits and pay increases.4\n\nWe believe the apparent misalignment between Starbucks' public commitments and its reported conduct represents material reputational, legal, and operational risks and may impact its long- term value. As Starbucks' 2021 10-K states \"our responses to any organizing efforts could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and have adverse effects on our business, including on our financial results.\" Failing to respect workers' rights could harm Starbucks reputation with consumers and hurt its ability to attract and retain a high-performing workforce, a crucial element of its ability to provide quality products and service. Research shows that union membership may have a positive effect on retention, in some cases, reducing resignations by as much as 65%.5 Studies show companies spend approximately 20% of an employee's salary to replace them.6\n\nGreater transparency on these issues could help address concerns about associated risks, and enable investors to perform human rights due diligence and assess Starbucks' adherence to its human rights commitments.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\t- https:/www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/04/new-york-starbucks-closed-union-drive; https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/business/economy/starbucks-union-howard-schultz\nnlrb.html\n\n- https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/starbucks-alleges-labor-board-misconduct-union-elections-us-cafes-2022-08-15;https://www.law360.com/employment-\nauthority/starbucks-tracker;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/06/starbucks-accused-of-more-than-200-labor-violations-in-nlrb-complaint.html https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/labor-\nboard-files-complaint-against-starbucks-for-withholding-raises-from-unionized-stores;https://www.nirb.gov/about-nlrb/what-we-do/investig\n\n\t- 3 s://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/starbucks-ordered-reinstate-workers-fired-amid-union-campaign-2022-08-184\n\n\t- 4 https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/business/economy/starbucks-union-howard-schultz-nlrb.html\n\n5\n\n- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226530917_The_Impact_of_Union_Membership_on_Intent_to_Leave_Additional_Evidence_on_the_Voice_Face_of_Union\n\n- 6 https://www.americanprogress.org/article/there-are-significant-business-costs-to-replacing-employees/"}
