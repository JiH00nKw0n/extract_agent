The representation metric will operate as a modifier to the payout of the fiscal 2022 PRSU award.\n\nAnnual EPS performance targets are set each year and then averaged at the conclusion of the three-year performance period to determine baseline payouts from 0-200% and three-year relative TSR performance is measured against the S&P 500. The PRSUs granted in fiscal 2022 reflect this structure and represent 60% of target long-term award value for fiscal 2022.\n\nThe extent to which PRSUs are earned is based on our achievement of annual adjusted EPS, relative TSR goals measured over a three-year period following the grant date, and, with respect to fiscal 2022 PRSUs, achievement of inclusion and diversity goals. Annual EPS targets are measured and certified by the Compensation Committee each year. To reflect performance above or below target, adjusted EPS has a sliding scale that provides for payouts greater than the target number of PRSUs if performance results are greater than target (up to a maximum 200% of payout) or less than the target number if performance results are lower than target (down to a 25% payout for threshold performance below which\n\n52\n\nthe payout would be 0%). If the threshold EPS goal under the PRSUs is not met, then the awards will pay out at zero. Linear interpolation will be applied to performance that falls between EPS goals.\n\nTo the extent the performance targets are met, earned PRSUs generally vest 100% on the third anniversary of the grant date, with a possible adjustment upward or downward of 25% based on achievement of predetermined relative TSR goals and, with respect to fiscal 2022 PRSUs, a possible adjustment upward or downward of up to 10% based on achievement of predetermined inclusion and diversity goals.\n\nThe TSR metric will modify the fiscal 2022 PRSUs (as well our other outstanding PRSU grants) as follows: (i) upwards to a maximum of 125% if Starbucks TSR ranking is equal to or exceeds the 75th percentile, and (ii) downwards to a threshold of 75% if the Starbucks TSR ranking is equal to or below the 25th percentile, with linear interpolation to be applied if Starbucks TSR ranking is between the 25th and 75th percentile and above and below the 50th percentile.\n\n## RELATIVE TSR MODIFIER\n\n<table><tr><th>25th Percentile</th><th>50th Percentile</th><th>75th Percentile</th></tr><tr><td>75%</td><td>100%</td><td>125%</td></tr></table>\n\nThe representation metric will modify the fiscal 2022 PRSUs as follows: (i) upwards to a maximum of 110% if the inclusion and diversity goal of 5% representation growth is met or exceeded; (ii) reducing the number of PRSUs earned by 5% if the inclusion and diversity goal is not achieved but growth is positive and below 5%; and (iii) reducing the number of PRSUs earned by 10% if representation falls over the three-year performance period.\n\n## REPRESENTATION MODIFIER ¹\n\n<table><tr><th>&lt;0%</th><th>&gt;0% and &lt;5%</th><th>&gt;5%</th></tr><tr><td>90%</td><td>95%</td><td>110%</td></tr></table>\n\n(1) For improvement of representation of Black, Indigenous, and Latinx partners at the manager level and above.\n\nThe threshold, target, and maximum number of PRSUs that could have been earned by the NEOs are disclosed in the Fiscal 2022 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table on page 65.\n\n2023 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n53"}
