The Company has had annual votes starting with the 2012 annual meeting, following the advisory vote of shareholders in favor of annual \"say on pay\" votes, which was reaffirmed at the Company's 2017 annual meeting.\n\nWhile the Company's executive compensation programs are designed to promote a long-term connection between pay and performance, the board recognizes that executive compensation disclosures are made annually. Holding an annual advisory vote on executive compensation provides the Company with more direct and immediate feedback on our compensation disclosures. We believe that an annual advisory vote on executive compensation is consistent with our practice of seeking input and engaging in dialogue with our shareholders on corporate governance matters (including the Company's practice of having all directors elected annually and annually providing shareholders the opportunity to ratify the Audit Committee's selection of independent auditors) and our executive compensation philosophy, policies and practices.\n\nAlthough the vote is non-binding, the board will consider the vote results in determining the frequency of future say-on-pay votes. The Company will announce its decision on the frequency of say-on-pay votes in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC no later than 150 days after the Annual Meeting. Notwithstanding the board's recommendation and the outcome of the shareholder vote, the board may in the future decide to conduct advisory votes on a more or less frequent basis and may vary its practice based on factors such as discussions with shareholders and the adoptions of material changes to compensation programs.\n\n## Board Recommendation\n\nThe board of directors recommends a vote to conduct future advisory votes on executive compensation EVERY YEAR.\n\n72\n\nPROPOSAL 4"}

In contrast, the nondairy milk market, including oat, coconut, soy, and almond milks, is projected to grow from over $25 billion in 2022 to over $61 billion by 2029. Three major factors are driving the demand for nondairy milk: taste, lactose intolerance, and environmental concerns\n\nResearch shows that 82% of people who consume plant-based milk do so because they prefer the taste.\n\nWhile many people prefer nondairy milk over cow's milk, other individuals can't tolerate cow's milk at all: 95% of Asian, 80 to 100% of Native American, 60 to 80% of Black, and 50 to 80% of Latinx populations suffer from lactose intolerance Nonwhites currently comprise nearly 40% of the U.S. population, and that segment is growing, which means that increasing numbers of Americans may hesitate to visit Starbucks or order drinks that include milk because of our current upcharge on nondairy milk.\n\nApproximately 56% of surveyed individuals who choose nondairy milk do so because of environmental concerns. Starbucks has publicly disclosed that dairy milk is the biggest contributor to our company's carbon footprint and the second-highest contributor to water usage. Cattle, including dairy COWS, account for roughly 40% of all greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture; plant-based milks produce less than one-third of CO2 emissions It takes 144 gallons of water to produce just 1 gallon of dairy milk; nondairy milks require up to 90% less water.\n\nStarbucks has committed to increasing plant-based options as a way of investing in an environmentally friendly menu. It is reasonable for shareholders to request an analysis of the potential costs to our company of the current upcharge on nondairy milk with regard to public relations and lost sales. Accordingly, we urge all shareholders to support this resolution."}

Our aim is to provide our customers with a variety of food and beverage choices in addition to sustainable dairy, and we have collaborated with plant-based innovators so that today nearly all stores across our markets offer plant-based food and beverage menu items. We continue to introduce new drinks and food items to menus while innovating with plant-based ingredients across key platforms like espresso, cold brew, refreshers, and food to meet growing customer demand globally. Since the beginning of our 2022 fiscal year, we have launched three new beverage innovations featuring plant-based milk, including the Iced Sugar Cookie Almond Milk Latte offered as part of our holiday 2022 menu.\n\nOur recent plant-based beverage innovations build on our demonstrated track record of providing customers with more choices. We began offering plant-based milk to customers in the U.S. in 1997 when we added soymilk to menus As non-dairy beverages grew in popularity, we added coconut milk in 2015, almond milk in 2016, and expanded to offer oat milk nationally in 2021. We continue to innovate to expand plant-based menus and use technology to support greater adoption for plant-based options. In April 2021, in partnership with Arizona State University, we announced the ASU-Starbucks Center for the Future of People and the Planet, which focuses on initiatives aimed to deliver scalable impact towards our aspirational sustainability goals for 2030 and beyond.

The Center is also developing tools and training to improve environmental impacts and opportunities for current and new products.\n\nCustomers can customize any beverage on the menu with a variety of plant-based milk options, including soymilk, coconut milk, almond milk, and oat milk. As with other beverage customizations, the price for plant-based milk customization varies by market and depends on a mix of considerations In some geographies, market conditions allow us to price plant-based milk more closely to dairy milk than in others. For instance, there is currently no additional charge for customizing beverages with plant-based milk in our Company-operated markets in the United Kingdom or Japan or licensed markets in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, or Luxembourg. Even in the United States, adding a splash of any plant-based milk to Brewed Coffee, Iced Coffee, Cold Brew, and Americano beverages is offered to our customers free of charge.\n\nIn addition to our efforts to increase plant-based offerings, Starbucks has innovated and worked with others to source high-quality dairy, responsibly and sustainably. In 2021, Starbucks launched its first on-farm pilot through U.S. Dairy Net Zero Initiative with Alliance Dairy to explore technologies related to renewable and organic fertilizer and water reuse. Starbucks also works with Agolin to improve feed efficiency and reduce enteric methane and is also collaborating with The Nature Conservancy to help refine and scale our approach to sustainable dairy and environmental stewardship.\n\nStarbucks has long been committed to a resource-positive future and to expanding our plant-based menu items. As with all product offerings, we continuously evaluate the market for, and the price of, our plant-based menu items, including plant-based milk customizations Commissioning a separate report on the impact of our pricing strategy for plant-based milk customizations would divert resources from our ongoing efforts to expand plant-based options for our customers, a goal that we hope the proponent shares.\n\nThe board of directors recommends that our shareholders vote against this proposal.\n\n## Board Recommendation\n\nThe board of directors recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal.\n\n76\n\n# PROPOSAL 6\n\n# SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING CEO SUCCESSION PLANNING POLICY AMENDMENT\n\n## RESOLVED\n\nShareholders request the Starbucks Board of Directors (the \"Board\") initiate the appropriate process to amend the Corporate Governance Principles and Practices for the Board of Directors to expand upon the CEO succession planning policy to include the following components:\n\n- development and annual evaluation of position qualifications to reflect Starbucks business strategy;\n\nprocedures to identify and develop internal candidates;\n\n- a formal assessment process to annually evaluate the progress of internal candidates;\n\n- requirements that succession planning begin at least three years before an expected transition and emergency succession planning is ongoing; and\n\n- standards and metrics to annual evaluate the performance of the succession planning process."}

According to the International Labour Organization, \"Freedom of association refers to the right of workers to create and join organizations of their choice freely and without fear of reprisal or interference\" and collective bargaining \"allows workers to negotiate their working conditions freely with their employers.\"\n\nIn the U.S., many workers allege that Starbucks has interfered with these rights, including retaliation, intimidation, firings, captive audience meetings, store closings, undue surveillance, and illegally excluding unionized employees from wage and benefit increases-generating negative media coverage. Workers at hundreds of stores have voted to unionize, and regional offices of the National Labor Relations Board, after finding merit to hundreds of allegations of labor rights violations, have issued at least 20 complaints against Starbucks.2\n\nIn August 2022, a U.S. judge ordered Starbucks to reinstate seven Memphis, Tennessee employees who were allegedly fired for supporting an organizing campaign. 3 Also in August, the labor board requested that Howard Schultz read a notice to all employees informing them that some had been unlawfully denied benefits and pay increases.4\n\nWe believe the apparent misalignment between Starbucks' public commitments and its reported conduct represents material reputational, legal, and operational risks and may impact its long- term value. As Starbucks' 2021 10-K states \"our responses to any organizing efforts could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and have adverse effects on our business, including on our financial results.\" Failing to respect workers' rights could harm Starbucks reputation with consumers and hurt its ability to attract and retain a high-performing workforce, a crucial element of its ability to provide quality products and service. Research shows that union membership may have a positive effect on retention, in some cases, reducing resignations by as much as 65%.5 Studies show companies spend approximately 20% of an employee's salary to replace them.6\n\nGreater transparency on these issues could help address concerns about associated risks, and enable investors to perform human rights due diligence and assess Starbucks' adherence to its human rights commitments.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\t- https:/www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/04/new-york-starbucks-closed-union-drive; https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/business/economy/starbucks-union-howard-schultz\nnlrb.html\n\n- https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/starbucks-alleges-labor-board-misconduct-union-elections-us-cafes-2022-08-15;https://www.law360.com/employment-\nauthority/starbucks-tracker;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/06/starbucks-accused-of-more-than-200-labor-violations-in-nlrb-complaint.html https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/labor-\nboard-files-complaint-against-starbucks-for-withholding-raises-from-unionized-stores;https://www.nirb.gov/about-nlrb/what-we-do/investig\n\n\t- 3 s://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/starbucks-ordered-reinstate-workers-fired-amid-union-campaign-2022-08-184\n\n\t- 4 https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/business/economy/starbucks-union-howard-schultz-nlrb.html\n\n5\n\n- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226530917_The_Impact_of_Union_Membership_on_Intent_to_Leave_Additional_Evidence_on_the_Voice_Face_of_Union\n\n- 6 https://www.americanprogress.org/article/there-are-significant-business-costs-to-replacing-employees/"}

Human rights in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights include the U.N. Universal Declaration on Human Rights as well as the 1998 International Labour Organization Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (referred to as the \"1998 Declaration\"). The 1998 Declaration includes the principle of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, among other fundamental labor rights. These principles, as they are defined at the international level, are highly nuanced and manifest themselves through the application of a nation's laws. U.S. labor law conforms to these principles; specifically, U.S. labor law reflects the principle that workers have the right to select a representative of their own choosing and, implicit in that principle, is the right of workers to choose not to be represented by a labor organization. Moreover, a cornerstone principle of U.S. labor law provides that all parties, including employers, have the right to freedom of expression and opinion in connection with union organizing efforts, provided there is no interference with this fundamental right. The ILO's Committee on Freedom of Association has confirmed that employers enjoy such a right.\n\nStarbucks contends that it complies with U.S. law with respect to freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. It should be noted that the current General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board has taken policy measures to expand and enhance U.S. law beyond previously established precedent. This policy shift has coincided with efforts of some Starbucks partners to seek union representation, which commenced in Buffalo, New York and has extended elsewhere in the country, impacting approximately 3% of Starbucks stores. Throughout this process, Starbucks has endeavored to comply with the law and we are committed to ensuring that it continue to do so. To the extent claims have been brought against Starbucks for violation of labor laws, the company has committed to defend itself where it believes the allegations are unfounded. To date, Starbucks has not been found to have violated the law as part of any enforced Order of the National Labor Relations Board."}
