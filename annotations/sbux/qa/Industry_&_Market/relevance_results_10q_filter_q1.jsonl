As of July 2, 2023, Starbucks had more than 37,200 company-operated and licensed stores, an increase of 7% from the prior year. Additionally, we sell a variety of consumer-packaged goods, primarily through the Global Coffee Alliance established with Nestlé and other partnerships and joint ventures.\n\nWe have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada, 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other.\n\nWe believe our financial results and long-term growth model will continue to be driven by new store openings, comparable store sales growth and operating margin management, underpinned by disciplined capital allocation. We believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. Throughout this MD&A, we commonly discuss the following key operating metrics:\n\n•New store openings and store count\n\n•Comparable store sales growth\n\n•Operating margin\n\nComparable store sales growth represents the percentage change in sales in one period from the same prior year period for company-operated stores open for 13 months or longer and exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. We analyze comparable store sales growth on a constant currency basis as this helps identify underlying business trends, without distortion from the effects of currency movements. Stores that are temporarily closed or operating at reduced hours due to the COVID-19 pandemic remain in comparable store sales while stores identified for permanent closure have been removed.\n\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. Fiscal 2023 and 2022 include 52 weeks. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of store closures, unless otherwise noted.\n\nStarbucks results for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 demonstrate the overall strength of our brand. Consolidated net revenues increased 12% to $9.2 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $8.2 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily driven by strength in our U.S. business and international licensed markets as well as continued recovery from COVID-19 pandemic-related business interruptions in China. During the quarter ended July 2, 2023, our global comparable store sales grew 10%, primarily driven by 7% growth in the U.S. market and 24% growth internationally, demonstrating the strength of the Starbucks brand globally. Consolidated operating margin increased 140 basis points from the prior year to 17.3%, primarily driven by sales leverage, pricing and productivity improvement from increased efficiency in our U.S. stores. These were partially offset by previously-committed investments in labor, including enhancements in retail store partner wages and benefits as well as increased general and administrative costs related to our Reinvention Plan.\n\nResults of Operations (in millions)\n\nRevenues"}
