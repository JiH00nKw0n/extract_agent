Each of our NEOs who was eligible to earn an annual cash incentive award under the annual Executive Management Bonus Plan (\"Annual Incentive Bonus Plan\") would have earned an award based on our financial and operational results, progress against our ESG initiatives, and their individual performance. However, given our overall financial and operational performance in fiscal 2022 and given that transformation efforts under our Reinvention Plan remain ongoing, our Compensation Committee elected not to pay any such awards for fiscal 2022. Our fiscal 2020 PRSUs (awarded in November 2019) paid out at only 61.25% due to our inability to achieve the rigorous earnings targets and our total shareholder return performance compared to the S&P 500 during the last three fiscal years. Further, Mr. Johnson's long-term cash performance-based award that was originally granted in December 2019 did not pay out given the challenging relative total shareholder return targets that were set for such award were not achieved"}

At our 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. approximately 92.4% of our shareholders who cast votes supported our advisory vote on executive compensation. In addition, every year, we engage with shareholders representing a significant portion of our outstanding shares on a variety of topics, including our executive compensation program. During 2022, as part of our regular shareholder outreach, we engaged with our top shareholders, representing nearly 30% of our total shares outstanding. The shareholders with whom we engaged generally expressed support for our executive compensation program, and were also supportive of the meaningful enhancements that we made to our program in fiscal 2022, which included, among other things, clarifying that the non-financial individual performance factor portion of our Annual Incentive Bonus Plan would be weighted at 30% in the aggregate, and providing for more formulaic payout metrics for ESG goals.\n\nIn evaluating our compensation practices for fiscal 2023, the Compensation Committee was mindful of the feedback provided by shareholders and continued to refine our Annual Incentive Bonus Plan to more closely align compensation with company financial performance and further demonstrate our commitment to value creation for shareholders, including an increased focus on sales and earnings given the effects of COVID-19, supply chain and materials costs, potential difficulties in China, and the Company's transformation in connection with our Reinvention Plan. Beginning with the fiscal 2023 Annual Incentive Bonus Plan, 70% of each participant's target incentive opportunity will be earned based on adjusted net revenue and adjusted operating income financial metrics, increased from 50% and the remaining 30% will be earned based on ESG metrics (15% increased from 10% in fiscal 2022) and individual performance (15% decreased from 30% in fiscal 2022).

Because Mr. Johnson was retirement eligible, his PRSUs and RSUs continued to vest under the terms of his existing award agreements. As discussed above, Mr. Johnson did not earn a cash incentive award, and he received the same payout of his fiscal 2019 PRSUs as other employees. In addition, Mr. Johnson's long-term cash performance-based award, which he was granted in December 2019, did not pay out as described above.\n\n## Separation of John Culver\n\nEffective October 1, 2022, we eliminated the chief operating officer role and Mr. Culver remained employed with the Company in a senior advisor role through January 1, 2023. Due to there no longer being an equivalent role for Mr. Culver, his employment was involuntarily terminated on January 2, 2023. Mr. Culver has executed a Separation Agreement and Release, which provided for the severance benefits set forth in our Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan in consideration for a release of claims in favor of Starbucks, and compliance with restrictive covenants, which included, among other provisions, compliance with non-solicitation, non-competition, and non-disparagement requirements."}
