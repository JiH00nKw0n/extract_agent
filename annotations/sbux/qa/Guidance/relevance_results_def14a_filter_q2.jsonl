Together with our partners, we have co-created a Reinvention plan that touches every aspect of the Starbucks Experience. For our customers, we are using technology to make their visits to our stores personalized and effortless, while also freeing up store partners to focus on creating more moments of connection. We are meeting them where they are, whether that's a Cold Brew on the go from a Pick-Up store, a quiet moment with a cappuccino inside one of our cafés, or a deep-dive into coffee education with a workshop at our new Starbucks Reserve location at the Empire State Building. For our partners, we are equipping them with better tools and training and have committed more than $1 billion in partner and store experience investments We are bringing coffee excellence, coffee craft, and joy and a little bit of love back into being a Starbucks barista.\n\nOver the past year, we have seen that the demand the prior year to a record $32.3 billion, driven by phenomenal 8 percent global growth in comparable store sales. Starbucks International continues to drive growth for the company, and we expect two-thirds of global retail growth over the next three years to come from our international business As we continue to navigate the COVID pandemic and its impacts in China, we are focused on supporting our partners and leaders in the market and look forward to a bright future ahead.\n\nOur impact at Starbucks ripples on a global scale. We take this responsibility seriously and strive to make a positive difference in the lives of the people we serve and the planet we share. We believe that every partner and every customer should have a sense of belonging at Starbucks, and should be able to be their authentic selves every day. We are dedicated to advancing racial and social equity, and we are committed to furthering that work with intention, transparency, and accountability. We are striving to be a resource-positive company, to give back more of the planet's resources than we consume. To help us get there, we have clear and ambitious sustainability targets to reduce our carbon, water, and waste footprints in half by 2030. Additionally, we are integrating sustainability throughout our Reinvention efforts, working to ensure we are considering the impacts to sustainability with each one of our strategies.\n\n## Onward\n\nThe new fiscal year also marks a new chapter with incoming ceo, Laxman Narasimhan. Since joining the company in October, he has been traveling around the world and immersing in our company and culture. Each day we have together, including time in Origin with our extended leadership team this Fall in Hacienda Alcasia, Costa Rica, we are reminded he is an extraordinary global citizen and servant leader who is embracing the vision of Starbucks in his own way.\n\nWe are both so proud of the company Starbucks is today and will be tomorrow, and profoundly grateful to the more than 400,000 Starbucks partners who are a part of this great odyssey. We would also like to extend our appreciation to the Starbucks Board of Directors for their leadership and support during this time of reinvention and renewal. We are laying the foundation for the future of a Starbucks even more true to our shared mission: To inspire and nurture the human spirit - one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.\n\nWith respect and gratitude,\n\n(hssignature21-\n04a.gif\n\nHoward Schultz\nchief executive officer\n\nMellody Hobson\nindependent chair of the board\n\n*Growth rate is based on a 52-week basis.

Johnson as president and chief executive officer, and the appointment of Starbucks founder, Howard Schultz, as interim chief executive officer in April 2022. Our board of directors selected Mr. Schultz based on his role in building Starbucks into one of the world's most recognized and respected businesses, a company focused on delivering best-in-class financial performance, through exceeding the expectations of our people and our customers Under his leadership, Starbucks grew from 11 stores with 100 partners to more than 28,000 stores in 77 countries, and he pioneered programs like comprehensive healthcare, stock ownership, and free college tuition for full and part-time partners.\n\nAdditional leadership and organizational changes followed in fiscal 2022, which concluded with the appointment of Laxman Narasimhan, as chief executive officer-elect in October 2022. Mr. Narasimhan is expected to be appointed as our permanent chief executive officer in April 2023. Mr. Narasimhan brings nearly 30 years of experience leading and advising global consumer- facing brands. Known for his considerable operational expertise, he has a proven track record in developing purpose-led brands, and building on companies histories, he has succeeded in rallying talent to deliver on future ambitions by driving consumer-centric and digital innovations.\n\nGuided by Mr. Schultz and our partners, in fiscal 2022, we began to implement our Reinvention Plan, an inspired roadmap to build the future of Starbucks, while staying true to our mission of uplifting communities through a shared love for coffee and further extending our coffee leadership and innovation. Starbucks partners are at the core of the Reinvention Plan, and we are committed to investing in our partner base through recruiting, training, and onboarding initiatives. As part of the Reinvention Plan, we also are continuing to unlock the intersection of convenience and connection by introducing enhancements to the customer experience across the retail and digital realms. Finally, we are seeking to continue to accelerate our leadership position in international markets through the strength of our licensing model, the digital Starbucks Experience and purpose-driven growth in China.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we continued to manage the business through global economic uncertainties, inflationary pressures, a resurgence of COVID-19 in China, and lower government subsidies. In fiscal 2022, we grew global revenues 13%* year-over-year to a record $32.3 billion, driven by 8% comparable stores sales growth globally and 12% comparable stores sales growth in North America as we saw meaningful growth in our global customer base. In the U.S., we grew our unique customers 9% year-over-year, and we saw a 16%* increase in U.S. Starbucks Rewards membership year-over-year to nearly 29 million members. However, international comparable store sales decreased 9%, primarily attributable to COVID-19 related restrictions in China, and our operating income and operating margin for the International segment decreased, driven primarily by lower sales related to COVID-19 restrictions in China, investments in our partners, and lower government subsidies."}

See, e.g., \"Doing business in China is difficult. A clash over human rights is making it harder,\" April 2. 2021,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/02/business/nike-china-western-business-intJ-hnk/index.html.\n\nStarbucks has 5,400 stores in over 200 cities across China, and relies on raw materials, finished products, labor and/or services from entities in the communist nation. China is an established serial violator of human and political rights.\n\n- China is also a hostile adversary of the U.S. for many reasons, including:\n\n- China intends to displace the U.S. as the lone global superpower by 2049;\n\n- The U.S. has committed to defend Taiwan, which China has militaristically asserted is part of its country and may attempt to seize by force:\n\n- U.S.-China relations are tense over a number of issues including China's military expansion; egregious human rights violations; actions related to the COVID pandemic; intellectual property theft; relentless espionage; elimination of freedom in Hong Kong; and environmental pollution.\n\nChina has also indicated that it would use its industrial capabilities for strategic purposes against adversaries.\n\nMany Chinese companies which are ultimately under the control of the Communist government-are vulnerable to the U.S. Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, do not adhere to basic auditing standards, and are therefore untrustworthy.\n\nChina and by extension the companies it controls is also identified in the U.S. State Department's 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report as a state sponsor of human trafficking. It is now subject to the Uyghur Forced labor Prevention Act, which imposes strict verification of parts and products imported from China, that they are not generated from slave labor.\n\nStarbucks's extensive ties to China breed reputational risk for the company also. For example, while the company funds groups that promote the interests of homosexual and transgender individuals, the Communist government persistently and vigorously cracks down on those forms of identity within its borders.\n\nA July 2022 joint statement from the leaders of the British and American domestic intelligence agencies warned that the Communist Chinese Party is the greatest threat to the international order. \"We consistently see that it's the Chinese government that poses the biggest long-term threat to our economic and national security, and by our,' I mean both of our nations, along with our allies in Europe and elsewhere,\" said FBI Director Christopher Wray.\n\nGiven the controversial, if not dangerous, nature of doing business in and with China, shareholders have the right to know the extent to which Starbucks Corporation's business operations\n\ndepend on Communist China."}
