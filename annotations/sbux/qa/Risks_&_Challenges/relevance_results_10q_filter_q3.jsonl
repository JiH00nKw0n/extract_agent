There have been no material changes to our material cash requirements during the period covered by this 10-Q outside of the normal course of our business.\n\nCash Flows\n\nCash provided by operating activities was $4.1 billion for the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, compared to $3.3 billion for the same period in fiscal 2022. The change was primarily due to a decrease in net cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities and higher net earnings during the period.\n\nCash used in investing activities totaled $1.4 billion for each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. Increased maturities and calls of investments in fiscal 2023 were offset by increased capital expenditures and higher investment purchases.\n\nCash used in financing activities for the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 totaled $2.1 billion compared to cash used in financing activities of $5.1 billion for the same period in fiscal 2022. The change is primarily due to a decrease in share repurchase activities.\n\nCommodity Prices, Availability and General Risk Conditions\n\nCommodity price risk represents our primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impact our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details, see Product Supply in Item 1 of the 10-K, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of the 10-K.\n\nSeasonality and Quarterly Results\n\nOur business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, of which our fiscal second quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income. Additionally, as our stored value cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season, we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year. However, since revenues from our stored value cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced. As a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since the 10-K.\n\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\nSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this 10-Q, for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements.\n\nItem 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nThere has been no material change in the commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, equity security price risk or interest rate risk discussed in Item 7A of the 10-K.\n\n38"}
