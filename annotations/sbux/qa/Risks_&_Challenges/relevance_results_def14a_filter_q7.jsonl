Together with our partners, we have co-created a Reinvention plan that touches every aspect of the Starbucks Experience. For our customers, we are using technology to make their visits to our stores personalized and effortless, while also freeing up store partners to focus on creating more moments of connection. We are meeting them where they are, whether that's a Cold Brew on the go from a Pick-Up store, a quiet moment with a cappuccino inside one of our cafés, or a deep-dive into coffee education with a workshop at our new Starbucks Reserve location at the Empire State Building. For our partners, we are equipping them with better tools and training and have committed more than $1 billion in partner and store experience investments We are bringing coffee excellence, coffee craft, and joy and a little bit of love back into being a Starbucks barista.\n\nOver the past year, we have seen that the demand the prior year to a record $32.3 billion, driven by phenomenal 8 percent global growth in comparable store sales. Starbucks International continues to drive growth for the company, and we expect two-thirds of global retail growth over the next three years to come from our international business As we continue to navigate the COVID pandemic and its impacts in China, we are focused on supporting our partners and leaders in the market and look forward to a bright future ahead.\n\nOur impact at Starbucks ripples on a global scale. We take this responsibility seriously and strive to make a positive difference in the lives of the people we serve and the planet we share. We believe that every partner and every customer should have a sense of belonging at Starbucks, and should be able to be their authentic selves every day. We are dedicated to advancing racial and social equity, and we are committed to furthering that work with intention, transparency, and accountability. We are striving to be a resource-positive company, to give back more of the planet's resources than we consume. To help us get there, we have clear and ambitious sustainability targets to reduce our carbon, water, and waste footprints in half by 2030. Additionally, we are integrating sustainability throughout our Reinvention efforts, working to ensure we are considering the impacts to sustainability with each one of our strategies.\n\n## Onward\n\nThe new fiscal year also marks a new chapter with incoming ceo, Laxman Narasimhan. Since joining the company in October, he has been traveling around the world and immersing in our company and culture. Each day we have together, including time in Origin with our extended leadership team this Fall in Hacienda Alcasia, Costa Rica, we are reminded he is an extraordinary global citizen and servant leader who is embracing the vision of Starbucks in his own way.\n\nWe are both so proud of the company Starbucks is today and will be tomorrow, and profoundly grateful to the more than 400,000 Starbucks partners who are a part of this great odyssey. We would also like to extend our appreciation to the Starbucks Board of Directors for their leadership and support during this time of reinvention and renewal. We are laying the foundation for the future of a Starbucks even more true to our shared mission: To inspire and nurture the human spirit - one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.\n\nWith respect and gratitude,\n\n(hssignature21-\n04a.gif\n\nHoward Schultz\nchief executive officer\n\nMellody Hobson\nindependent chair of the board\n\n*Growth rate is based on a 52-week basis.

We believe in investing in the health and well-being of the nearly 500,000 farmers who grow high-quality arabica coffee from diverse regions around the world as we work together to ensure a sustainable future of coffee for all.\n\nFor example, the Starbucks Global Farmer Fund was created to improve supply chain resiliency and ensure a long-term supply of coffee by addressing the unmet business financing needs of farmers. Starbucks is also working to deliver 100 million disease-resistant coffee trees to farmers globally. Together, we help farmers increase their productivity, quality of life, and profitability by driving solutions that support our communities globally and support a healthy planet.\n\nStarbucks global commitment to fundamental human rights is a core component of how we live our mission and values wherever we do business around the world. We respect the inherent dignity of all people and seek to enable partners to do their best work by embracing and valuing the unique combination of talents, experiences, and perspectives they each bring to our work. Our goal is to be one of the most inclusive companies globally, working toward full equity, inclusion, and accessibility for those whose lives we touch.\n\nStarbucks strives to give back more than we take from our planet.

With our partners, we are strengthening our communities and co-creating a more resilient future. From Neighborhood Grants nominated by partners who know their neighbors and communities best, to our commitment to farmers around the globe, to championing their communities, Starbucks partners are deeply invested in their communities.\n\n14\n\nAnd our commitment to build a more equitable, sustainable, and resilient future includes a commitment to the environment.

The Governance Principles provide that our Compensation Committee has general oversight responsibility for management development and succession planning practices and strategy. Our Compensation Committee, pursuant to its charter, annually reviews and discusses with the independent directors of the board the performance of certain senior officers of the Company and the succession plans for each such officer's position including\n\n28\n\nrecommendations and evaluations of potential successors to fill these positions.

A primary responsibility of the board is planning for ceo succession The chair of our Nominating/Governance Committee, together with the chair of the board (or, if the chair of the board is not independent, the lead independent director), the chair of the Compensation Committee, and the ceo (collectively, the \"succession planning team\") will annually evaluate and update as appropriate the skills, experience, and attributes that the board believes are important to be an effective ceo in light of our business strategy. The succession planning team will also annually review with the board, our ceo succession planning process, including the identification, development, and progress of internal candidates and how candidates have been assessed. Chief executive officer succession planning should be an ongoing process, with the goal of providing sufficient lead time before an expected transition while also being prepared for and responsive to unexpected developments.\n\n## Oversight of ESG\n\nOur board is highly engaged in ESG matters given that our global social impact, sustainability goals, and human capital are intricately linked to our strategic direction. Our board considers these matters at least annually in connection with the strategic plan. In addition, except where explicitly delegated to other board committees or retained by the board, our Nominating/Governance Committee is tasked with the responsibility of overseeing the effectiveness of our environmental, social, and corporate governance strategies, policies, practices, goals, and programs, including review of our annual Global Environmental and Social Impact Report. Further, our Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of human capital development plans and succession planning practices to foster sufficient management depth at the Company to support its continued growth and the talent needed to execute long-term strategies, while our Audit Committee is tasked with overseeing the Company's risk management, including with respect to certain ESG topics.\n\n## Board\n\nOur board is responsible for ensuring ESG risks and opportunities are integrated into Starbucks long-term strategy.\n\n## Nominating/Governance Committee\n\nOversees, reviews, and assesses the effectiveness of Starbucks ESG strategies, policies, practices, goals, and programs; annually reviews Starbucks corporate political contributions and expenditures to ensure alignment with Starbucks policies and values.\n\n## Compensation Committee\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nOversees certain ESG risks, as\npart of overall risk management,\nand also reviews ESG\ndisclosures in SEC filings.\n\nOversees the development,\nimplementation, and effectiveness of\nStarbucks practices, policies, and\nstrategies relating to human capital\nmanagement as they relate to Starbucks\nworkforce generally."}

The ESG performance goals will comprise Inclusion & Diversity goals as well as sustainability goals, which will continue to be objective and quantitative to ensure clear, rigorous goal-setting with respect to our ESG strategies and objectives. The Committee also updated our Inclusion & Diversity metrics for fiscal 2023 to both remove complexity and provide more relevancy to our Inclusion & Diversity goals, providing a clearer and more impactful path for participants to drive our progress in our people-positive efforts. Further, the profit-positive goals that applied for fiscal 2022, which included operating margin, comparable store sales, and net new stores, were eliminated for fiscal 2023 as the Compensation Committee determined that the outcome of such metrics was largely reflected in the adjusted net revenue and adjusted operating income metrics and ultimately duplicative of the financial performance metrics under the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan.\n\nThe IPF component of the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan for fiscal 2023 will represent 15% of the overall Annual Incentive Bonus Plan payout (from 30% for fiscal 2022).

To ensure an effective and smooth transition, Mr. Johnson continued to provide executive transition services through the end of fiscal 2022, and his base salary and annual bonus opportunity were reduced by 50% effective June 1, 2022, in proportion to the level of services he was expected to provide. Because Mr. Johnson was retirement eligible, his PRSUs and RSUs continued to vest under the terms of his existing award agreements. As discussed above, Mr. Johnson did not earn a cash incentive award, and he received the same payout of his fiscal 2019 PRSUs as other employees. In addition, Mr. Johnson's long-term cash performance-based award, which he was granted in December 2019, did not pay out as described above.\n\n## Separation of John Culver\n\nEffective October 1, 2022, we eliminated the chief operating officer role and Mr. Culver remained employed with the Company in a senior advisor role through January 1, 2023. Due to there no longer being an equivalent role for Mr. Culver, his employment was involuntarily terminated on January 2, 2023. Mr. Culver has executed a Separation Agreement and Release, which provided for the severance benefits set forth in our Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan in consideration for a release of claims in favor of Starbucks, and compliance with restrictive covenants, which included, among other provisions, compliance with non-solicitation, non-competition, and non-disparagement requirements."}

In contrast, the nondairy milk market, including oat, coconut, soy, and almond milks, is projected to grow from over $25 billion in 2022 to over $61 billion by 2029. Three major factors are driving the demand for nondairy milk: taste, lactose intolerance, and environmental concerns\n\nResearch shows that 82% of people who consume plant-based milk do so because they prefer the taste.\n\nWhile many people prefer nondairy milk over cow's milk, other individuals can't tolerate cow's milk at all: 95% of Asian, 80 to 100% of Native American, 60 to 80% of Black, and 50 to 80% of Latinx populations suffer from lactose intolerance Nonwhites currently comprise nearly 40% of the U.S. population, and that segment is growing, which means that increasing numbers of Americans may hesitate to visit Starbucks or order drinks that include milk because of our current upcharge on nondairy milk.\n\nApproximately 56% of surveyed individuals who choose nondairy milk do so because of environmental concerns. Starbucks has publicly disclosed that dairy milk is the biggest contributor to our company's carbon footprint and the second-highest contributor to water usage. Cattle, including dairy COWS, account for roughly 40% of all greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture; plant-based milks produce less than one-third of CO2 emissions It takes 144 gallons of water to produce just 1 gallon of dairy milk; nondairy milks require up to 90% less water.\n\nStarbucks has committed to increasing plant-based options as a way of investing in an environmentally friendly menu. It is reasonable for shareholders to request an analysis of the potential costs to our company of the current upcharge on nondairy milk with regard to public relations and lost sales. Accordingly, we urge all shareholders to support this resolution."}

Our aim is to provide our customers with a variety of food and beverage choices in addition to sustainable dairy, and we have collaborated with plant-based innovators so that today nearly all stores across our markets offer plant-based food and beverage menu items. We continue to introduce new drinks and food items to menus while innovating with plant-based ingredients across key platforms like espresso, cold brew, refreshers, and food to meet growing customer demand globally. Since the beginning of our 2022 fiscal year, we have launched three new beverage innovations featuring plant-based milk, including the Iced Sugar Cookie Almond Milk Latte offered as part of our holiday 2022 menu.\n\nOur recent plant-based beverage innovations build on our demonstrated track record of providing customers with more choices. We began offering plant-based milk to customers in the U.S. in 1997 when we added soymilk to menus As non-dairy beverages grew in popularity, we added coconut milk in 2015, almond milk in 2016, and expanded to offer oat milk nationally in 2021. We continue to innovate to expand plant-based menus and use technology to support greater adoption for plant-based options.

In April 2022, former CEO Kevin Johnson retired and Howard Schultz returned as Interim CEO while the Board searched for a permanent replacement. In explaining Starbucks' external search, Schultz told a reporter, \"For the future of the company, we need a domain of experience and expertise in a number of disciplines that we don't have now.\" While there may be circumstances where an external candidate is the best choice, not having any viable internal candidates is evidence of the Board's weak succession planning.\n\nReportedly, the Board was notified of Johnson's pending retirement at least one year in advance. Poor succession planning resulted in Starbucks losing a critical component of a smooth transition: business continuity. Rather than Johnson playing a large role in the onboarding of a successor, Laxman Narasimhan spent months shadowing Schultz who was retired for five years before his recent return. Adding to the bumpy transition, Schultz launched a \"Reinvention Plan\" that included changes to Starbucks strategy and leadership structure prior to Narasimhan's start.²\n\nAn effective succession planning process includes the regular evaluation of skills and competencies needed in a successor, identification of promising internal candidates, and a talent development strategy. A dynamic policy would better equip Starbucks for an emergency or planned succession with capable internal candidates and a candidate profile to expedite an external search. Developing a robust leadership pipeline has a myriad of benefits including retained institutional knowledge and increased employee morale and retention. The current policy is lacking, and we fear the Board is overly reliant on Schultz, as this was his second return.\n\nResearch suggests that poorly planned successions and external successors negatively impact financial performance. A 2006 study found that delays in hiring a successor and recruiting externally decreased subsequent financial performance. Research published in the Harvard Business Review in 2021 suggests that CEOs hired internally could perform better than external hires 61% of the time.4 A 2001 study found that hiring externally following a CEO retirement precipitated a nearly 6% drop in performance. Given these risks, Starbucks would benefit from a robust succession planning policy that produces viable internal candidates going forward.\n\n- 1 https://www.wsj.com/articles/howard-schultz-says-starbucks-is-seeking-fresh-blood-in-ceo-search-11654488060\n\n- 2 htps://www.restaurantdive.com/news/Starbucks-eliminates-COO-role/630060/;https:/investor.starbucks.com/press-releases/financial-releases/press-release-details/2022/Starbucks-Enters\new-Era-of-Growth-Driven-by-an-Unparalleled-Reinvention-Plan/default.aspx\n\n- 3 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287508898_Deaths_of_CEOs_Are_delays_in_naming_successors_and_insideroutsider_succession_associated_with_subsequent_firm_performan\n\n4 ps://hbr.org/2021/05/the-high-cost-of-poor-succession-planning\n\n- 5 https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/leadership-the-performance-impact-of-new-ceos/\n\n## BOARD RECOMMENDATION\n\nThe Starbucks board of directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons:\n\nOur Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our board of directors reviewed proponent's proposal and directed our general counsel and our corporate secretary to propose revisions to our Corporate Governance Principles and Practices for the Board of Directors (our \"Governance Principles\") that would consider suggestions made in the proposal.

According to the International Labour Organization, \"Freedom of association refers to the right of workers to create and join organizations of their choice freely and without fear of reprisal or interference\" and collective bargaining \"allows workers to negotiate their working conditions freely with their employers.\"\n\nIn the U.S., many workers allege that Starbucks has interfered with these rights, including retaliation, intimidation, firings, captive audience meetings, store closings, undue surveillance, and illegally excluding unionized employees from wage and benefit increases-generating negative media coverage. Workers at hundreds of stores have voted to unionize, and regional offices of the National Labor Relations Board, after finding merit to hundreds of allegations of labor rights violations, have issued at least 20 complaints against Starbucks.2\n\nIn August 2022, a U.S. judge ordered Starbucks to reinstate seven Memphis, Tennessee employees who were allegedly fired for supporting an organizing campaign. 3 Also in August, the labor board requested that Howard Schultz read a notice to all employees informing them that some had been unlawfully denied benefits and pay increases.4\n\nWe believe the apparent misalignment between Starbucks' public commitments and its reported conduct represents material reputational, legal, and operational risks and may impact its long- term value. As Starbucks' 2021 10-K states \"our responses to any organizing efforts could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and have adverse effects on our business, including on our financial results.\" Failing to respect workers' rights could harm Starbucks reputation with consumers and hurt its ability to attract and retain a high-performing workforce, a crucial element of its ability to provide quality products and service. Research shows that union membership may have a positive effect on retention, in some cases, reducing resignations by as much as 65%.5 Studies show companies spend approximately 20% of an employee's salary to replace them.6\n\nGreater transparency on these issues could help address concerns about associated risks, and enable investors to perform human rights due diligence and assess Starbucks' adherence to its human rights commitments.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\t- https:/www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/04/new-york-starbucks-closed-union-drive; https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/business/economy/starbucks-union-howard-schultz\nnlrb.html\n\n- https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/starbucks-alleges-labor-board-misconduct-union-elections-us-cafes-2022-08-15;https://www.law360.com/employment-\nauthority/starbucks-tracker;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/06/starbucks-accused-of-more-than-200-labor-violations-in-nlrb-complaint.html https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/labor-\nboard-files-complaint-against-starbucks-for-withholding-raises-from-unionized-stores;https://www.nirb.gov/about-nlrb/what-we-do/investig\n\n\t- 3 s://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/starbucks-ordered-reinstate-workers-fired-amid-union-campaign-2022-08-184\n\n\t- 4 https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/business/economy/starbucks-union-howard-schultz-nlrb.html\n\n5\n\n- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226530917_The_Impact_of_Union_Membership_on_Intent_to_Leave_Additional_Evidence_on_the_Voice_Face_of_Union\n\n- 6 https://www.americanprogress.org/article/there-are-significant-business-costs-to-replacing-employees/"}

It subsequently instituted sweeping policy changes by introducing a \"third place policy\" that invited non-customers to enjoy using Starbucks facilities, including its bathrooms, despite not making a single purchase. In doing so, Starbucks invited the exact behavior that it now laments as the cause of its store closures. Worse yet, the company flat out ignored an independent academic study that found that Starbucks open bathroom policy was hurting its bottom-line.\n\nChanging company policy to now permit individual stores to make their own decisions as to whether to have an open bathroom policy is an important first step in addressing the decisions that led to the safety concerns experienced in the first place, but it is just that, a first step.10 Reflecting upon the company's policy positions and advocacy decisions-and assessing how they have contributed to its need to close stores due to safety issues is therefore necessary to keep additional stores from closing and to protect shareholders."}
