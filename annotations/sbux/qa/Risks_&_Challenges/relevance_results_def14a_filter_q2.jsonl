The succession planning team will also annually review with the board, our ceo succession planning process, including the identification, development, and progress of internal candidates and how candidates have been assessed.

For example, while the company funds groups that promote the interests of homosexual and transgender individuals, the Communist government persistently and vigorously cracks down on those forms of identity within its borders.\n\nA July 2022 joint statement from the leaders of the British and American domestic intelligence agencies warned that the Communist Chinese Party is the greatest threat to the international order. \"We consistently see that it's the Chinese government that poses the biggest long-term threat to our economic and national security, and by our,' I mean both of our nations, along with our allies in Europe and elsewhere,\" said FBI Director Christopher Wray.\n\nGiven the controversial, if not dangerous, nature of doing business in and with China, shareholders have the right to know the extent to which Starbucks Corporation's business operations\n\ndepend on Communist China."}

As Starbucks' 2021 10-K states \"our responses to any organizing efforts could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and have adverse effects on our business, including on our financial results.\" Failing to respect workers' rights could harm Starbucks reputation with consumers and hurt its ability to attract and retain a high-performing workforce, a crucial element of its ability to provide quality products and service. Research shows that union membership may have a positive effect on retention, in some cases, reducing resignations by as much as 65%.5 Studies show companies spend approximately 20% of an employee's salary to replace them.6\n\nGreater transparency on these issues could help address concerns about associated risks, and enable investors to perform human rights due diligence and assess Starbucks' adherence to its human rights commitments.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\t- https:/www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/04/new-york-starbucks-closed-union-drive; https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/business/economy/starbucks-union-howard-schultz\nnlrb.html\n\n- https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/starbucks-alleges-labor-board-misconduct-union-elections-us-cafes-2022-08-15;https://www.law360.com/employment-\nauthority/starbucks-tracker;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/06/starbucks-accused-of-more-than-200-labor-violations-in-nlrb-complaint.html https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/labor-\nboard-files-complaint-against-starbucks-for-withholding-raises-from-unionized-stores;https://www.nirb.gov/about-nlrb/what-we-do/investig\n\n\t- 3 s://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/starbucks-ordered-reinstate-workers-fired-amid-union-campaign-2022-08-184\n\n\t- 4 https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/business/economy/starbucks-union-howard-schultz-nlrb.html\n\n5\n\n- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226530917_The_Impact_of_Union_Membership_on_Intent_to_Leave_Additional_Evidence_on_the_Voice_Face_of_Union\n\n- 6 https://www.americanprogress.org/article/there-are-significant-business-costs-to-replacing-employees/"}

Human rights in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights include the U.N. Universal Declaration on Human Rights as well as the 1998 International Labour Organization Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (referred to as the \"1998 Declaration\"). The 1998 Declaration includes the principle of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, among other fundamental labor rights. These principles, as they are defined at the international level, are highly nuanced and manifest themselves through the application of a nation's laws. U.S. labor law conforms to these principles; specifically, U.S. labor law reflects the principle that workers have the right to select a representative of their own choosing and, implicit in that principle, is the right of workers to choose not to be represented by a labor organization. Moreover, a cornerstone principle of U.S. labor law provides that all parties, including employers, have the right to freedom of expression and opinion in connection with union organizing efforts, provided there is no interference with this fundamental right. The ILO's Committee on Freedom of Association has confirmed that employers enjoy such a right.\n\nStarbucks contends that it complies with U.S. law with respect to freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. It should be noted that the current General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board has taken policy measures to expand and enhance U.S. law beyond previously established precedent. This policy shift has coincided with efforts of some Starbucks partners to seek union representation, which commenced in Buffalo, New York and has extended elsewhere in the country, impacting approximately 3% of Starbucks stores. Throughout this process, Starbucks has endeavored to comply with the law and we are committed to ensuring that it continue to do so. To the extent claims have been brought against Starbucks for violation of labor laws, the company has committed to defend itself where it believes the allegations are unfounded. To date, Starbucks has not been found to have violated the law as part of any enforced Order of the National Labor Relations Board."}

For example, the NLRB pursued injunctive relief in Federal Court in Arizona that the court denied, concluding that the NLRB did not have a likelihood of success on the merits, in part, because the NLRB premised its filing on testimony that was later found to be untrue. Likewise, an NLRB administrative law judge recently issued a decision in which the complaint filed by the NLRB General Counsel against Starbucks was dismissed. One NLRB official has reported to the agency's Inspector General that the agency's handling of Starbucks representation elections has been done in a way that is biased in favor of supporters of the union. This is contrary to the law, which confers upon employees the right to form, join, or assist a labor organization, or to refrain from doing so. The NLRB Inspector General has publicly announced his investigation into these reports.\n\nMoreover, where partners have selected a labor organization as their exclusive representative, Starbucks has committed to comply with the law and the rights of its partners to engage in collective bargaining.\n\nWhile we do not believe or agree that the independent, third-party assessment advanced by the proponent is necessary or in the best interest of Starbucks, its shareholders, or its partners, we recognize that Starbucks commitment to respect human rights within the framework of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights comes with the corresponding expectation that the company undertake human rights due diligence. Starbucks has commenced efforts to conduct a human rights impact assessment as a process to identify, assess, and address the company's most salient human rights impacts across the value chain. In developing the scope for the Starbucks human rights impact assessment, the company expects to prioritize salient human rights for deeper level review. To that end, labor rights principles outlined in the 1998 Declaration, including the principles of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, will be included in that process. As part of Starbucks commitment to transparency with respect to our global social and environmental impacts, we expect to make available the results of Starbucks human rights impact assessment to shareholders, stakeholders, and other interested parties. Recognizing that care must be taken when reporting on matters that are in active litigation because of privilege concerns, and recognizing that the proponents' proposal acknowledges that reality,\n\n82\n\nStarbucks expects to give due consideration to inclusion of labor rights where practicable and where such reporting does not adversely impact the company's litigation position.\n\nThe board of directors recommends that our shareholders vote against this proposal.\n\n## Board Recommendation\n\nThe board of directors recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal.\n\n2023 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n83\n\n# PROPOSAL 9\n\n# SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING CREATION OF BOARD COMMITTEE ON CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY\n\nRESOLVED\n\nShareholders of Starbucks request that the Board of Directors create a board committee on corporate sustainability to oversee and review the impact of the company's policy positions and advocacy on matters relating to the company's ongoing growth and sustainability. The company shall issue a public report on the committee's findings by the end of 2023."}
