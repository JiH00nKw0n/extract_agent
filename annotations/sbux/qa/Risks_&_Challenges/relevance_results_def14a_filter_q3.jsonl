This process is enterprise-wide for managers up to and including our ceo.\n\nOur board's involvement in our annual succession planning process is outlined in our Governance Principles. The Governance Principles provide that our Compensation Committee has general oversight responsibility for management development and succession planning practices and strategy. Our Compensation Committee, pursuant to its charter, annually reviews and discusses with the independent directors of the board the performance of certain senior officers of the Company and the succession plans for each such officer's position including\n\n28\n\nrecommendations and evaluations of potential successors to fill these positions. The Compensation Committee also conducts a periodic review of, and provides approval for, our management development and succession planning practices and strategies, including the review and oversight of risks and exposures associated with the succession planning practices and strategies.\n\n## ceo Succession Planning\n\nAs discussed in the board's recommendation on Proposal 6 Regarding ceo Succession Planning Policy Amendment, which is set forth on page 77, the board recently amended the Governance Principles to expand on ceo succession planning. A primary responsibility of the board is planning for ceo succession The chair of our Nominating/Governance Committee, together with the chair of the board (or, if the chair of the board is not independent, the lead independent director), the chair of the Compensation Committee, and the ceo (collectively, the \"succession planning team\") will annually evaluate and update as appropriate the skills, experience, and attributes that the board believes are important to be an effective ceo in light of our business strategy. The succession planning team will also annually review with the board, our ceo succession planning process, including the identification, development, and progress of internal candidates and how candidates have been assessed. Chief executive officer succession planning should be an ongoing process, with the goal of providing sufficient lead time before an expected transition while also being prepared for and responsive to unexpected developments.\n\n## Oversight of ESG\n\nOur board is highly engaged in ESG matters given that our global social impact, sustainability goals, and human capital are intricately linked to our strategic direction. Our board considers these matters at least annually in connection with the strategic plan. In addition, except where explicitly delegated to other board committees or retained by the board, our Nominating/Governance Committee is tasked with the responsibility of overseeing the effectiveness of our environmental, social, and corporate governance strategies, policies, practices, goals, and programs, including review of our annual Global Environmental and Social Impact Report. Further, our Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of human capital development plans and succession planning practices to foster sufficient management depth at the Company to support its continued growth and the talent needed to execute long-term strategies, while our Audit Committee is tasked with overseeing the Company's risk management, including with respect to certain ESG topics.\n\n## Board\n\nOur board is responsible for ensuring ESG risks and opportunities are integrated into Starbucks long-term strategy.\n\n## Nominating/Governance Committee\n\nOversees, reviews, and assesses the effectiveness of Starbucks ESG strategies, policies, practices, goals, and programs; annually reviews Starbucks corporate political contributions and expenditures to ensure alignment with Starbucks policies and values.\n\n## Compensation Committee\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nOversees certain ESG risks, as\npart of overall risk management,\nand also reviews ESG\ndisclosures in SEC filings.\n\nOversees the development,\nimplementation, and effectiveness of\nStarbucks practices, policies, and\nstrategies relating to human capital\nmanagement as they relate to Starbucks\nworkforce generally."}

Our chief information security officer is ultimately responsible for our cybersecurity program, which includes the implementation of controls aligned with industry guidelines and applicable statutes and regulations to identify threats, detect attacks, and protect these information assets. We have implemented security monitoring capabilities designed to alert us to suspicious activity and developed an incident response program that includes periodic testing and is designed to restore business operations as quickly and as orderly as possible in the event of a breach. In addition, partners participate in ongoing mandatory annual trainings and receive communications regarding the cybersecurity environment to increase awareness throughout the Company. Our Audit Committee, which oversees data privacy and cybersecurity risk matters, is comprised entirely of independent directors, one of whom has significant work experience related to information security issues and oversight. Management will report security instances to the Audit Committee as they occur, if material, and will also provide a summary multiple times per year to the Audit Committee Additionally, our chief information security officer meets at least twice annually with the board of directors or the Audit Committee to brief them on technology and information security matters. We carry insurance that provides protection against the potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident. In the last three years, the expenses we have incurred from information security breach incidences were immaterial. This includes penalties and settlements, of which there were none.\n\n## Shareholder Engagement\n\nWe have a year-round shareholder outreach program through which we solicit feedback on diverse business areas, ranging from our executive compensation program and corporate governance practices to disclosure practices and environmental and social impact programs and goals. We share feedback we receive with our board of directors, as well as other board committees such as the Compensation Committee and the Nominating/Governance Committee, as appropriate. Our board considers feedback received from shareholders throughout the year, and such input influences changes to our compensation program and the adoption of new governance practices. Every year, our outreach effort is conducted by a cross-functional team including: Investor Relations, Law & Corporate Affairs, Inclusion and Diversity, Public Affairs, Global Coffee, Sustainability and Social Impact, and Partner Resources Organization. Additionally, our ceo and cfo are engaged in meaningful dialogue with our shareholders through our quarterly earnings calls and investor-related outreach events. For more information about our shareholder engagement, see page 11.\n\n## ROLE OF OUR BOARD COMMITTEES\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, our board of directors had three standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating/Governance Committee. The board of directors, upon recommendation of the Nominating/Governance Committee, makes committee and committee chair assignments annually at its meeting immediately preceding the annual meeting of shareholders, and makes changes to committee assignments as deemed appropriate by the board. The committees operate pursuant to written charters, which are available on our website at www.starbucks.com/about- us/company-information/corporate-governance."}

The Company maintains aircraft to facilitate business travel. The Company has adopted a comprehensive Corporate Aircraft Use Policy, including guidelines for annual reporting to the Audit Committee to ensure transparency relative to aircraft usage and the business purpose served. In accordance with the Corporate Aircraft Use Policy, the executive officers may enter into an aircraft time-sharing agreement, which allows them to use corporate aircraft for personal travel under the terms outlined in such aircraft time-sharing agreement between them and the Company. Personal use of the aircraft by an executive officer pursuant to the time-sharing agreement requires them to reimburse the Company for the operating expenses of such flights that is chargeable pursuant to Federal Aviation Regulations. The Company's Corporate Aircraft Use Policy allows for personal guests of executive officers and board members to travel on business-related flights on our corporate aircraft under certain limited circumstances. The policy also allows for certain executive personal travel done in connection with flight that is otherwise for a business-purpose. Both types of use result in imputed income to the executive or director under Internal Revenue Service regulations and, for NEOs, \"other compensation\" equal to the aggregate incremental costs to the Company resulting from such personal travel, which is reported in the Summary Compensation Table.\n\n- Security. We believe that the personal safety and security of our senior executives is of the utmost importance to the Company and its shareholders. Pursuant to our executive security program, we may from time to time provide personal security services to certain executives. Security services include home security systems and monitoring and, in some cases, personal security services. These protections are provided due to the range of security issues encountered by senior executives of large, multinational corporations and particularly with respect to high-profile executives. Based on a security study, the Company made the decision to provide personal security services to Mr. Schultz due to security considerations arising from his role as our interim chief executive officer and his significant visibility as our founder. We view the security services provided to Mr. Schultz as an integral part of our risk management program and as necessary and appropriate business expenses, given his importance to Starbucks. However, because such services may be viewed as conveying a personal benefit to Mr. Schultz, we have reported the aggregate incremental costs of such services in the \"All Other Compensation\" column of the Summary Compensation Table.\n\n- The Company did not pay personal security costs for any other executive in fiscal 2022, except in connection with business-related travel."}

If an executive is not on track to meet the requirement by the end of the third year after becoming subject to the guidelines, they will be required to hold 50% of the net shares received upon the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs.

Based upon this review, management and the Compensation Committee concluded that our compensation practices and policies do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company, and Pay Governance supported this conclusion. A report summarizing the results of this assessment was reviewed and discussed with the Compensation Committee at its September 2022 meeting."}

In contrast, the nondairy milk market, including oat, coconut, soy, and almond milks, is projected to grow from over $25 billion in 2022 to over $61 billion by 2029. Three major factors are driving the demand for nondairy milk: taste, lactose intolerance, and environmental concerns\n\nResearch shows that 82% of people who consume plant-based milk do so because they prefer the taste.\n\nWhile many people prefer nondairy milk over cow's milk, other individuals can't tolerate cow's milk at all: 95% of Asian, 80 to 100% of Native American, 60 to 80% of Black, and 50 to 80% of Latinx populations suffer from lactose intolerance Nonwhites currently comprise nearly 40% of the U.S. population, and that segment is growing, which means that increasing numbers of Americans may hesitate to visit Starbucks or order drinks that include milk because of our current upcharge on nondairy milk.\n\nApproximately 56% of surveyed individuals who choose nondairy milk do so because of environmental concerns. Starbucks has publicly disclosed that dairy milk is the biggest contributor to our company's carbon footprint and the second-highest contributor to water usage. Cattle, including dairy COWS, account for roughly 40% of all greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture; plant-based milks produce less than one-third of CO2 emissions It takes 144 gallons of water to produce just 1 gallon of dairy milk; nondairy milks require up to 90% less water.\n\nStarbucks has committed to increasing plant-based options as a way of investing in an environmentally friendly menu.

In April 2022, former CEO Kevin Johnson retired and Howard Schultz returned as Interim CEO while the Board searched for a permanent replacement. In explaining Starbucks' external search, Schultz told a reporter, \"For the future of the company, we need a domain of experience and expertise in a number of disciplines that we don't have now.\" While there may be circumstances where an external candidate is the best choice, not having any viable internal candidates is evidence of the Board's weak succession planning.\n\nReportedly, the Board was notified of Johnson's pending retirement at least one year in advance. Poor succession planning resulted in Starbucks losing a critical component of a smooth transition: business continuity. Rather than Johnson playing a large role in the onboarding of a successor, Laxman Narasimhan spent months shadowing Schultz who was retired for five years before his recent return. Adding to the bumpy transition, Schultz launched a \"Reinvention Plan\" that included changes to Starbucks strategy and leadership structure prior to Narasimhan's start.²\n\nAn effective succession planning process includes the regular evaluation of skills and competencies needed in a successor, identification of promising internal candidates, and a talent development strategy. A dynamic policy would better equip Starbucks for an emergency or planned succession with capable internal candidates and a candidate profile to expedite an external search. Developing a robust leadership pipeline has a myriad of benefits including retained institutional knowledge and increased employee morale and retention. The current policy is lacking, and we fear the Board is overly reliant on Schultz, as this was his second return.\n\nResearch suggests that poorly planned successions and external successors negatively impact financial performance. A 2006 study found that delays in hiring a successor and recruiting externally decreased subsequent financial performance. Research published in the Harvard Business Review in 2021 suggests that CEOs hired internally could perform better than external hires 61% of the time.4 A 2001 study found that hiring externally following a CEO retirement precipitated a nearly 6% drop in performance. Given these risks, Starbucks would benefit from a robust succession planning policy that produces viable internal candidates going forward.\n\n- 1 https://www.wsj.com/articles/howard-schultz-says-starbucks-is-seeking-fresh-blood-in-ceo-search-11654488060\n\n- 2 htps://www.restaurantdive.com/news/Starbucks-eliminates-COO-role/630060/;https:/investor.starbucks.com/press-releases/financial-releases/press-release-details/2022/Starbucks-Enters\new-Era-of-Growth-Driven-by-an-Unparalleled-Reinvention-Plan/default.aspx\n\n- 3 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287508898_Deaths_of_CEOs_Are_delays_in_naming_successors_and_insideroutsider_succession_associated_with_subsequent_firm_performan\n\n4 ps://hbr.org/2021/05/the-high-cost-of-poor-succession-planning\n\n- 5 https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/leadership-the-performance-impact-of-new-ceos/\n\n## BOARD RECOMMENDATION\n\nThe Starbucks board of directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons:\n\nOur Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our board of directors reviewed proponent's proposal and directed our general counsel and our corporate secretary to propose revisions to our Corporate Governance Principles and Practices for the Board of Directors (our \"Governance Principles\") that would consider suggestions made in the proposal.

According to the International Labour Organization, \"Freedom of association refers to the right of workers to create and join organizations of their choice freely and without fear of reprisal or interference\" and collective bargaining \"allows workers to negotiate their working conditions freely with their employers.\"\n\nIn the U.S., many workers allege that Starbucks has interfered with these rights, including retaliation, intimidation, firings, captive audience meetings, store closings, undue surveillance, and illegally excluding unionized employees from wage and benefit increases-generating negative media coverage. Workers at hundreds of stores have voted to unionize, and regional offices of the National Labor Relations Board, after finding merit to hundreds of allegations of labor rights violations, have issued at least 20 complaints against Starbucks.2\n\nIn August 2022, a U.S. judge ordered Starbucks to reinstate seven Memphis, Tennessee employees who were allegedly fired for supporting an organizing campaign. 3 Also in August, the labor board requested that Howard Schultz read a notice to all employees informing them that some had been unlawfully denied benefits and pay increases.4\n\nWe believe the apparent misalignment between Starbucks' public commitments and its reported conduct represents material reputational, legal, and operational risks and may impact its long- term value.

It subsequently instituted sweeping policy changes by introducing a \"third place policy\" that invited non-customers to enjoy using Starbucks facilities, including its bathrooms, despite not making a single purchase. In doing so, Starbucks invited the exact behavior that it now laments as the cause of its store closures. Worse yet, the company flat out ignored an independent academic study that found that Starbucks open bathroom policy was hurting its bottom-line.\n\nChanging company policy to now permit individual stores to make their own decisions as to whether to have an open bathroom policy is an important first step in addressing the decisions that led to the safety concerns experienced in the first place, but it is just that, a first step.10 Reflecting upon the company's policy positions and advocacy decisions-and assessing how they have contributed to its need to close stores due to safety issues is therefore necessary to keep additional stores from closing and to protect shareholders."}
