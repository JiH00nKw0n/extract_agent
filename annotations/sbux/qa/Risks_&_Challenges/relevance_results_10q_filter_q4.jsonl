In the opinion of management, the financial information for the quarters and three quarters ended July 2, 2023 and July 3, 2022 reflects all adjustments and accruals, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods. In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“10-Q”), Starbucks Corporation is referred to as “Starbucks,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our.”\n\nSegment information is prepared on the same basis that our management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes.\n\nThe financial information as of October 2, 2022 is derived from our audited consolidated financial statements and notes for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022 (“fiscal 2022”) included in Item 8 in the Fiscal 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K (“10-K”). The information included in this 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the footnotes and management’s discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements in the 10-K.\n\nThe results of operations for the quarter and three quarters ended July 2, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be achieved for the entire fiscal year ending October 1, 2023 (“fiscal 2023”).\n\nThe novel coronavirus, known as the global COVID-19 pandemic, was first identified in December 2019 before spreading to markets where we have company-operated or licensed stores. We have since established the necessary protocols to operate safely, and in many of our markets, our businesses demonstrated powerful momentum beyond recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. During the quarter ended July 2, 2023, our China market continued its recovery from pandemic-related business interruptions in previous quarters that had suppressed customer mobility. We continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on our business and results of operations; however, we cannot predict the duration, scope or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or its future impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nRestructuring\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we announced our plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience (the “Reinvention Plan”). We believe the company-operated market investments in partner wages and trainings have increased retention and productivity while the acceleration of purpose-built store concepts and innovations in technologies will provide additional convenience and connection with our customers. As a result of the restructuring efforts in connection with the Reinvention Plan, we recorded an immaterial charge on our consolidated statements of earnings during the quarter and three quarters ended July 2, 2023. Future restructuring and impairment costs attributable to our Reinvention Plan are not expected to be material.\n\nAs of July 2, 2023 and October 2, 2022, there were no material restructuring-related accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance related to reference rate reform. The pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burden related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and generally can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2024. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\n\nNote 2: Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Alliance\n\nFiscal 2023\n\nOn January 13, 2023, we sold the assets, primarily consisting of intellectual properties associated with the Seattle's Best Coffee brand, to Nestlé for $110.0 million. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $91.3 million, which was included in gain from sale of assets on our consolidated statements of earnings. Results from Seattle's Best Coffee operations prior to the sale are reported in our Channel Development operating segment.\n\n10"}

A portion of our price-to-be-fixed contracts are effectively fixed through the use of futures. See Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, for further discussion. Price-to-be-fixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore the price, at which the base “C” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. For most contracts, either Starbucks or the seller has the option to “fix” the base “C” coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date. For other contracts, Starbucks and the seller may agree upon pricing parameters determined by the base “C” coffee commodity price. Until prices are fixed, we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments. We believe, based on established relationships with our suppliers and continuous monitoring, the risk of non-delivery on these purchase commitments is remote.\n\nNote 6: Supplemental Balance Sheet and Statement of Earnings Information (in millions):\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, net"}

There have been no material changes to our material cash requirements during the period covered by this 10-Q outside of the normal course of our business.\n\nCash Flows\n\nCash provided by operating activities was $4.1 billion for the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, compared to $3.3 billion for the same period in fiscal 2022. The change was primarily due to a decrease in net cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities and higher net earnings during the period.\n\nCash used in investing activities totaled $1.4 billion for each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. Increased maturities and calls of investments in fiscal 2023 were offset by increased capital expenditures and higher investment purchases.\n\nCash used in financing activities for the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 totaled $2.1 billion compared to cash used in financing activities of $5.1 billion for the same period in fiscal 2022. The change is primarily due to a decrease in share repurchase activities.\n\nCommodity Prices, Availability and General Risk Conditions\n\nCommodity price risk represents our primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impact our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details, see Product Supply in Item 1 of the 10-K, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of the 10-K.\n\nSeasonality and Quarterly Results\n\nOur business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, of which our fiscal second quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income. Additionally, as our stored value cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season, we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year. However, since revenues from our stored value cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced. As a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since the 10-K.\n\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\nSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this 10-Q, for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements.\n\nItem 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nThere has been no material change in the commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, equity security price risk or interest rate risk discussed in Item 7A of the 10-K.\n\n38"}
