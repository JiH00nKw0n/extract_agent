Together with our partners, we have co-created a Reinvention plan that touches every aspect of the Starbucks Experience. For our customers, we are using technology to make their visits to our stores personalized and effortless, while also freeing up store partners to focus on creating more moments of connection. We are meeting them where they are, whether that's a Cold Brew on the go from a Pick-Up store, a quiet moment with a cappuccino inside one of our cafés, or a deep-dive into coffee education with a workshop at our new Starbucks Reserve location at the Empire State Building. For our partners, we are equipping them with better tools and training and have committed more than $1 billion in partner and store experience investments We are bringing coffee excellence, coffee craft, and joy and a little bit of love back into being a Starbucks barista.\n\nOver the past year, we have seen that the demand the prior year to a record $32.3 billion, driven by phenomenal 8 percent global growth in comparable store sales. Starbucks International continues to drive growth for the company, and we expect two-thirds of global retail growth over the next three years to come from our international business As we continue to navigate the COVID pandemic and its impacts in China, we are focused on supporting our partners and leaders in the market and look forward to a bright future ahead.\n\nOur impact at Starbucks ripples on a global scale. We take this responsibility seriously and strive to make a positive difference in the lives of the people we serve and the planet we share. We believe that every partner and every customer should have a sense of belonging at Starbucks, and should be able to be their authentic selves every day. We are dedicated to advancing racial and social equity, and we are committed to furthering that work with intention, transparency, and accountability. We are striving to be a resource-positive company, to give back more of the planet's resources than we consume. To help us get there, we have clear and ambitious sustainability targets to reduce our carbon, water, and waste footprints in half by 2030. Additionally, we are integrating sustainability throughout our Reinvention efforts, working to ensure we are considering the impacts to sustainability with each one of our strategies.\n\n## Onward\n\nThe new fiscal year also marks a new chapter with incoming ceo, Laxman Narasimhan. Since joining the company in October, he has been traveling around the world and immersing in our company and culture. Each day we have together, including time in Origin with our extended leadership team this Fall in Hacienda Alcasia, Costa Rica, we are reminded he is an extraordinary global citizen and servant leader who is embracing the vision of Starbucks in his own way.\n\nWe are both so proud of the company Starbucks is today and will be tomorrow, and profoundly grateful to the more than 400,000 Starbucks partners who are a part of this great odyssey. We would also like to extend our appreciation to the Starbucks Board of Directors for their leadership and support during this time of reinvention and renewal. We are laying the foundation for the future of a Starbucks even more true to our shared mission: To inspire and nurture the human spirit - one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.\n\nWith respect and gratitude,\n\n(hssignature21-\n04a.gif\n\nHoward Schultz\nchief executive officer\n\nMellody Hobson\nindependent chair of the board\n\n*Growth rate is based on a 52-week basis.

As part of that commitment, since 2001, Starbucks has proactively published the Global Environmental & Social Impact report, an annual fiscal year update on key ESG programs and progress.\n\nWe promote ethical leadership and business practices to deliver our very best in all we do, while holding ourselves accountable for results.

This also includes aspects of our sustainability initiatives and social impact agenda that relate to our strategy. The board's oversight of risk is another integral component of the board's oversight and engagement on strategic matters. Strategy-related matters are regularly discussed at board meetings and, when relevant, at committee meetings. We also dedicate at least one board meeting every year to an even more intensive review and discussion of the Company's strategic plan. Matters of strategy also inform committee-level discussions of many issues, including business risk. Engagement of the board on these issues and other matters of strategic importance continues in between meetings, including through updates to the board on significant items and discussions by the ceo with the independent chair of the board on a periodic basis. Each director is expected to and does bring to bear their own talents, insights, and experiences to these strategy discussions.\n\n## BEYOND THE BOARDROOM\n\nIn order to increase each director's engagement with and understanding of our strategy, each director participates in an extensive orientation program upon joining the board, including meeting with members of our executive leadership team and other key leaders of the Company to gain a deeper understanding of Starbucks businesses and operations, attending cultural immersion programs, and visiting our stores to engage with store partners and customers first-hand. Periodic briefing sessions are also provided to members of the board on subjects that would assist them in discharging their duties. Our directors also have the opportunity through our periodic investor day presentations to understand and assess how we are communicating our strategy to our investors and other important stakeholders.\n\n26\n\n# Risk Oversight\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nThe board of directors has overall responsibility for risk oversight. A fundamental part of risk oversight is not only understanding the material risks a company faces and the steps management is taking to manage those risks, but also understanding what level of risk is appropriate for that company. The involvement of the board in reviewing Starbucks business strategy is an integral aspect of the board's assessment of management's tolerance for risk and also its determination of what constitutes an appropriate level of risk for the Company.\n\nWhile the full board has overall responsibility for risk oversight, the board has delegated oversight responsibility related to certain risks to the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating/Governance Committee.\n\nin\n\n:-"}

This process is enterprise-wide for managers up to and including our ceo.\n\nOur board's involvement in our annual succession planning process is outlined in our Governance Principles. The Governance Principles provide that our Compensation Committee has general oversight responsibility for management development and succession planning practices and strategy. Our Compensation Committee, pursuant to its charter, annually reviews and discusses with the independent directors of the board the performance of certain senior officers of the Company and the succession plans for each such officer's position including\n\n28\n\nrecommendations and evaluations of potential successors to fill these positions. The Compensation Committee also conducts a periodic review of, and provides approval for, our management development and succession planning practices and strategies, including the review and oversight of risks and exposures associated with the succession planning practices and strategies.\n\n## ceo Succession Planning\n\nAs discussed in the board's recommendation on Proposal 6 Regarding ceo Succession Planning Policy Amendment, which is set forth on page 77, the board recently amended the Governance Principles to expand on ceo succession planning. A primary responsibility of the board is planning for ceo succession The chair of our Nominating/Governance Committee, together with the chair of the board (or, if the chair of the board is not independent, the lead independent director), the chair of the Compensation Committee, and the ceo (collectively, the \"succession planning team\") will annually evaluate and update as appropriate the skills, experience, and attributes that the board believes are important to be an effective ceo in light of our business strategy. The succession planning team will also annually review with the board, our ceo succession planning process, including the identification, development, and progress of internal candidates and how candidates have been assessed. Chief executive officer succession planning should be an ongoing process, with the goal of providing sufficient lead time before an expected transition while also being prepared for and responsive to unexpected developments.\n\n## Oversight of ESG\n\nOur board is highly engaged in ESG matters given that our global social impact, sustainability goals, and human capital are intricately linked to our strategic direction. Our board considers these matters at least annually in connection with the strategic plan. In addition, except where explicitly delegated to other board committees or retained by the board, our Nominating/Governance Committee is tasked with the responsibility of overseeing the effectiveness of our environmental, social, and corporate governance strategies, policies, practices, goals, and programs, including review of our annual Global Environmental and Social Impact Report. Further, our Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of human capital development plans and succession planning practices to foster sufficient management depth at the Company to support its continued growth and the talent needed to execute long-term strategies, while our Audit Committee is tasked with overseeing the Company's risk management, including with respect to certain ESG topics.\n\n## Board\n\nOur board is responsible for ensuring ESG risks and opportunities are integrated into Starbucks long-term strategy.\n\n## Nominating/Governance Committee\n\nOversees, reviews, and assesses the effectiveness of Starbucks ESG strategies, policies, practices, goals, and programs; annually reviews Starbucks corporate political contributions and expenditures to ensure alignment with Starbucks policies and values.\n\n## Compensation Committee\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nOversees certain ESG risks, as\npart of overall risk management,\nand also reviews ESG\ndisclosures in SEC filings.\n\nOversees the development,\nimplementation, and effectiveness of\nStarbucks practices, policies, and\nstrategies relating to human capital\nmanagement as they relate to Starbucks\nworkforce generally."}

We regularly perform evaluations of our security program and continue to invest in our capabilities to keep our customers, partners, and information assets safe. Our chief information security officer is ultimately responsible for our cybersecurity program, which includes the implementation of controls aligned with industry guidelines and applicable statutes and regulations to identify threats, detect attacks, and protect these information assets. We have implemented security monitoring capabilities designed to alert us to suspicious activity and developed an incident response program that includes periodic testing and is designed to restore business operations as quickly and as orderly as possible in the event of a breach. In addition, partners participate in ongoing mandatory annual trainings and receive communications regarding the cybersecurity environment to increase awareness throughout the Company. Our Audit Committee, which oversees data privacy and cybersecurity risk matters, is comprised entirely of independent directors, one of whom has significant work experience related to information security issues and oversight. Management will report security instances to the Audit Committee as they occur, if material, and will also provide a summary multiple times per year to the Audit Committee Additionally, our chief information security officer meets at least twice annually with the board of directors or the Audit Committee to brief them on technology and information security matters. We carry insurance that provides protection against the potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident. In the last three years, the expenses we have incurred from information security breach incidences were immaterial. This includes penalties and settlements, of which there were none.\n\n## Shareholder Engagement\n\nWe have a year-round shareholder outreach program through which we solicit feedback on diverse business areas, ranging from our executive compensation program and corporate governance practices to disclosure practices and environmental and social impact programs and goals. We share feedback we receive with our board of directors, as well as other board committees such as the Compensation Committee and the Nominating/Governance Committee, as appropriate. Our board considers feedback received from shareholders throughout the year, and such input influences changes to our compensation program and the adoption of new governance practices. Every year, our outreach effort is conducted by a cross-functional team including: Investor Relations, Law & Corporate Affairs, Inclusion and Diversity, Public Affairs, Global Coffee, Sustainability and Social Impact, and Partner Resources Organization. Additionally, our ceo and cfo are engaged in meaningful dialogue with our shareholders through our quarterly earnings calls and investor-related outreach events. For more information about our shareholder engagement, see page 11.\n\n## ROLE OF OUR BOARD COMMITTEES\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, our board of directors had three standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating/Governance Committee. The board of directors, upon recommendation of the Nominating/Governance Committee, makes committee and committee chair assignments annually at its meeting immediately preceding the annual meeting of shareholders, and makes changes to committee assignments as deemed appropriate by the board. The committees operate pursuant to written charters, which are available on our website at www.starbucks.com/about- us/company-information/corporate-governance."}

Johnson as president and chief executive officer, and the appointment of Starbucks founder, Howard Schultz, as interim chief executive officer in April 2022. Our board of directors selected Mr. Schultz based on his role in building Starbucks into one of the world's most recognized and respected businesses, a company focused on delivering best-in-class financial performance, through exceeding the expectations of our people and our customers Under his leadership, Starbucks grew from 11 stores with 100 partners to more than 28,000 stores in 77 countries, and he pioneered programs like comprehensive healthcare, stock ownership, and free college tuition for full and part-time partners.\n\nAdditional leadership and organizational changes followed in fiscal 2022, which concluded with the appointment of Laxman Narasimhan, as chief executive officer-elect in October 2022. Mr. Narasimhan is expected to be appointed as our permanent chief executive officer in April 2023. Mr. Narasimhan brings nearly 30 years of experience leading and advising global consumer- facing brands. Known for his considerable operational expertise, he has a proven track record in developing purpose-led brands, and building on companies histories, he has succeeded in rallying talent to deliver on future ambitions by driving consumer-centric and digital innovations.\n\nGuided by Mr. Schultz and our partners, in fiscal 2022, we began to implement our Reinvention Plan, an inspired roadmap to build the future of Starbucks, while staying true to our mission of uplifting communities through a shared love for coffee and further extending our coffee leadership and innovation. Starbucks partners are at the core of the Reinvention Plan, and we are committed to investing in our partner base through recruiting, training, and onboarding initiatives. As part of the Reinvention Plan, we also are continuing to unlock the intersection of convenience and connection by introducing enhancements to the customer experience across the retail and digital realms. Finally, we are seeking to continue to accelerate our leadership position in international markets through the strength of our licensing model, the digital Starbucks Experience and purpose-driven growth in China.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we continued to manage the business through global economic uncertainties, inflationary pressures, a resurgence of COVID-19 in China, and lower government subsidies. In fiscal 2022, we grew global revenues 13%* year-over-year to a record $32.3 billion, driven by 8% comparable stores sales growth globally and 12% comparable stores sales growth in North America as we saw meaningful growth in our global customer base. In the U.S., we grew our unique customers 9% year-over-year, and we saw a 16%* increase in U.S. Starbucks Rewards membership year-over-year to nearly 29 million members. However, international comparable store sales decreased 9%, primarily attributable to COVID-19 related restrictions in China, and our operating income and operating margin for the International segment decreased, driven primarily by lower sales related to COVID-19 restrictions in China, investments in our partners, and lower government subsidies."}

However, given our overall financial and operational performance in fiscal 2022 and given that transformation efforts under our Reinvention Plan remain ongoing, our Compensation Committee elected not to pay any such awards for fiscal 2022. Our fiscal 2020 PRSUs (awarded in November 2019) paid out at only 61.25% due to our inability to achieve the rigorous earnings targets and our total shareholder return performance compared to the S&P 500 during the last three fiscal years. Further, Mr. Johnson's long-term cash performance-based award that was originally granted in December 2019 did not pay out given the challenging relative total shareholder return targets that were set for such award were not achieved"}

Mr. Culver has executed a Separation Agreement and Release, which provided for the severance benefits set forth in our Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan in consideration for a release of claims in favor of Starbucks, and compliance with restrictive covenants, which included, among other provisions, compliance with non-solicitation, non-competition, and non-disparagement requirements."}

In contrast, the nondairy milk market, including oat, coconut, soy, and almond milks, is projected to grow from over $25 billion in 2022 to over $61 billion by 2029. Three major factors are driving the demand for nondairy milk: taste, lactose intolerance, and environmental concerns\n\nResearch shows that 82% of people who consume plant-based milk do so because they prefer the taste.\n\nWhile many people prefer nondairy milk over cow's milk, other individuals can't tolerate cow's milk at all: 95% of Asian, 80 to 100% of Native American, 60 to 80% of Black, and 50 to 80% of Latinx populations suffer from lactose intolerance Nonwhites currently comprise nearly 40% of the U.S. population, and that segment is growing, which means that increasing numbers of Americans may hesitate to visit Starbucks or order drinks that include milk because of our current upcharge on nondairy milk.\n\nApproximately 56% of surveyed individuals who choose nondairy milk do so because of environmental concerns. Starbucks has publicly disclosed that dairy milk is the biggest contributor to our company's carbon footprint and the second-highest contributor to water usage. Cattle, including dairy COWS, account for roughly 40% of all greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture; plant-based milks produce less than one-third of CO2 emissions It takes 144 gallons of water to produce just 1 gallon of dairy milk; nondairy milks require up to 90% less water.\n\nStarbucks has committed to increasing plant-based options as a way of investing in an environmentally friendly menu. It is reasonable for shareholders to request an analysis of the potential costs to our company of the current upcharge on nondairy milk with regard to public relations and lost sales. Accordingly, we urge all shareholders to support this resolution."}

We continue to innovate to expand plant-based menus and use technology to support greater adoption for plant-based options. In April 2021, in partnership with Arizona State University, we announced the ASU-Starbucks Center for the Future of People and the Planet, which focuses on initiatives aimed to deliver scalable impact towards our aspirational sustainability goals for 2030 and beyond.

In April 2022, former CEO Kevin Johnson retired and Howard Schultz returned as Interim CEO while the Board searched for a permanent replacement. In explaining Starbucks' external search, Schultz told a reporter, \"For the future of the company, we need a domain of experience and expertise in a number of disciplines that we don't have now.\" While there may be circumstances where an external candidate is the best choice, not having any viable internal candidates is evidence of the Board's weak succession planning.\n\nReportedly, the Board was notified of Johnson's pending retirement at least one year in advance. Poor succession planning resulted in Starbucks losing a critical component of a smooth transition: business continuity. Rather than Johnson playing a large role in the onboarding of a successor, Laxman Narasimhan spent months shadowing Schultz who was retired for five years before his recent return. Adding to the bumpy transition, Schultz launched a \"Reinvention Plan\" that included changes to Starbucks strategy and leadership structure prior to Narasimhan's start.²\n\nAn effective succession planning process includes the regular evaluation of skills and competencies needed in a successor, identification of promising internal candidates, and a talent development strategy. A dynamic policy would better equip Starbucks for an emergency or planned succession with capable internal candidates and a candidate profile to expedite an external search. Developing a robust leadership pipeline has a myriad of benefits including retained institutional knowledge and increased employee morale and retention. The current policy is lacking, and we fear the Board is overly reliant on Schultz, as this was his second return.\n\nResearch suggests that poorly planned successions and external successors negatively impact financial performance. A 2006 study found that delays in hiring a successor and recruiting externally decreased subsequent financial performance. Research published in the Harvard Business Review in 2021 suggests that CEOs hired internally could perform better than external hires 61% of the time.4 A 2001 study found that hiring externally following a CEO retirement precipitated a nearly 6% drop in performance. Given these risks, Starbucks would benefit from a robust succession planning policy that produces viable internal candidates going forward.\n\n- 1 https://www.wsj.com/articles/howard-schultz-says-starbucks-is-seeking-fresh-blood-in-ceo-search-11654488060\n\n- 2 htps://www.restaurantdive.com/news/Starbucks-eliminates-COO-role/630060/;https:/investor.starbucks.com/press-releases/financial-releases/press-release-details/2022/Starbucks-Enters\new-Era-of-Growth-Driven-by-an-Unparalleled-Reinvention-Plan/default.aspx\n\n- 3 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287508898_Deaths_of_CEOs_Are_delays_in_naming_successors_and_insideroutsider_succession_associated_with_subsequent_firm_performan\n\n4 ps://hbr.org/2021/05/the-high-cost-of-poor-succession-planning\n\n- 5 https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/leadership-the-performance-impact-of-new-ceos/\n\n## BOARD RECOMMENDATION\n\nThe Starbucks board of directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons:\n\nOur Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our board of directors reviewed proponent's proposal and directed our general counsel and our corporate secretary to propose revisions to our Corporate Governance Principles and Practices for the Board of Directors (our \"Governance Principles\") that would consider suggestions made in the proposal.

China is an established serial violator of human and political rights.\n\n- China is also a hostile adversary of the U.S. for many reasons, including:\n\n- China intends to displace the U.S. as the lone global superpower by 2049;\n\n- The U.S. has committed to defend Taiwan, which China has militaristically asserted is part of its country and may attempt to seize by force:\n\n- U.S.-China relations are tense over a number of issues including China's military expansion; egregious human rights violations; actions related to the COVID pandemic; intellectual property theft; relentless espionage; elimination of freedom in Hong Kong; and environmental pollution.\n\nChina has also indicated that it would use its industrial capabilities for strategic purposes against adversaries.\n\nMany Chinese companies which are ultimately under the control of the Communist government-are vulnerable to the U.S. Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, do not adhere to basic auditing standards, and are therefore untrustworthy.\n\nChina and by extension the companies it controls is also identified in the U.S. State Department's 2022 Trafficking in Persons Report as a state sponsor of human trafficking. It is now subject to the Uyghur Forced labor Prevention Act, which imposes strict verification of parts and products imported from China, that they are not generated from slave labor.\n\nStarbucks's extensive ties to China breed reputational risk for the company also.

According to the International Labour Organization, \"Freedom of association refers to the right of workers to create and join organizations of their choice freely and without fear of reprisal or interference\" and collective bargaining \"allows workers to negotiate their working conditions freely with their employers.\"\n\nIn the U.S., many workers allege that Starbucks has interfered with these rights, including retaliation, intimidation, firings, captive audience meetings, store closings, undue surveillance, and illegally excluding unionized employees from wage and benefit increases-generating negative media coverage. Workers at hundreds of stores have voted to unionize, and regional offices of the National Labor Relations Board, after finding merit to hundreds of allegations of labor rights violations, have issued at least 20 complaints against Starbucks.2\n\nIn August 2022, a U.S. judge ordered Starbucks to reinstate seven Memphis, Tennessee employees who were allegedly fired for supporting an organizing campaign. 3 Also in August, the labor board requested that Howard Schultz read a notice to all employees informing them that some had been unlawfully denied benefits and pay increases.4\n\nWe believe the apparent misalignment between Starbucks' public commitments and its reported conduct represents material reputational, legal, and operational risks and may impact its long- term value. As Starbucks' 2021 10-K states \"our responses to any organizing efforts could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and have adverse effects on our business, including on our financial results.\" Failing to respect workers' rights could harm Starbucks reputation with consumers and hurt its ability to attract and retain a high-performing workforce, a crucial element of its ability to provide quality products and service. Research shows that union membership may have a positive effect on retention, in some cases, reducing resignations by as much as 65%.5 Studies show companies spend approximately 20% of an employee's salary to replace them.6\n\nGreater transparency on these issues could help address concerns about associated risks, and enable investors to perform human rights due diligence and assess Starbucks' adherence to its human rights commitments.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\t- https:/www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/04/new-york-starbucks-closed-union-drive; https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/business/economy/starbucks-union-howard-schultz\nnlrb.html\n\n- https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/starbucks-alleges-labor-board-misconduct-union-elections-us-cafes-2022-08-15;https://www.law360.com/employment-\nauthority/starbucks-tracker;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/06/starbucks-accused-of-more-than-200-labor-violations-in-nlrb-complaint.html https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/labor-\nboard-files-complaint-against-starbucks-for-withholding-raises-from-unionized-stores;https://www.nirb.gov/about-nlrb/what-we-do/investig\n\n\t- 3 s://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/starbucks-ordered-reinstate-workers-fired-amid-union-campaign-2022-08-184\n\n\t- 4 https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/business/economy/starbucks-union-howard-schultz-nlrb.html\n\n5\n\n- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226530917_The_Impact_of_Union_Membership_on_Intent_to_Leave_Additional_Evidence_on_the_Voice_Face_of_Union\n\n- 6 https://www.americanprogress.org/article/there-are-significant-business-costs-to-replacing-employees/"}

We believe Starbucks can, and should, have a positive impact on the communities we serve and that our employees-our partners-are at the heart of the Starbucks experience. As a board, it is our responsibility to ensure that Starbucks business and affairs are managed to meet Starbucks stated goals and objectives and that long-term interests of shareholder are served. Part of that responsibility includes working with management and our partners to invest in our partners health, well-being, and success and to create a culture of belonging that is centered around putting our partners first and where everyone is welcome.\n\nWe are proud of our investments in our Starbucks partners:\n\n- We provide the highest-rated benefits in the country for full- and part-time hourly workers (including medical coverage and stock benefits).\n\n- We offer competitive pay - with a minimum of $15/hour and average pay across our company-owned U.S. stores that is nearing $17.50/hour.\n\nSince 1991, our Bean Stock program has provided our partners the opportunity to share in the financial success of the company through shares of our stock-it's the reason our employees\n\nare called partners.\n\n2023 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n81\n\n## SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS\n\n- We are broadening health insurance options, providing 100% upfront tuition coverage for college tuition through the Starbucks College Achievement Plan with Arizona State University, providing mental health services at no cost, and recently introduced a new suite of financial well-being benefits for our U.S. partners.\n\n- To make our partners' days run more smoothly, we're improving the way our 'behind the bar' space is organized so it's easier to navigate during busy times, creating easy processes for partners to sign up for and trade shifts to fit their schedules, and working to improve staffing at busy stores.\n\nStarbucks partners' voices and concerns are top priority for both management and this board-we are listening. We continue to believe that, together with our partners, we can build a company defined by dignity and respect for each other and our planet. We are united in the shared purpose of uplifting the partner experience today and for years to come.\n\nOn November 17, 2020, Kevin Johnson, our then chief executive officer, issued our Global Human Rights Statement Our Global Human Rights Statement is an extension of our mission: to inspire and nurture the human spirit - one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time. In the Global Human Rights statement, we reiterated the following:\n\nWe respect the human rights of individuals and communities impacted by our operations and products, and we commit to respect the principles of the: UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights; UN Global Compact; OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises; International Bill of Rights; ILO Core Labor Standards; Women's Empowerment Principles; Children's Rights and Business Principles, and Framework Principles on Human Rights and the Environment"}

Human rights in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights include the U.N. Universal Declaration on Human Rights as well as the 1998 International Labour Organization Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (referred to as the \"1998 Declaration\"). The 1998 Declaration includes the principle of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, among other fundamental labor rights. These principles, as they are defined at the international level, are highly nuanced and manifest themselves through the application of a nation's laws. U.S. labor law conforms to these principles; specifically, U.S. labor law reflects the principle that workers have the right to select a representative of their own choosing and, implicit in that principle, is the right of workers to choose not to be represented by a labor organization. Moreover, a cornerstone principle of U.S. labor law provides that all parties, including employers, have the right to freedom of expression and opinion in connection with union organizing efforts, provided there is no interference with this fundamental right. The ILO's Committee on Freedom of Association has confirmed that employers enjoy such a right.\n\nStarbucks contends that it complies with U.S. law with respect to freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. It should be noted that the current General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board has taken policy measures to expand and enhance U.S. law beyond previously established precedent. This policy shift has coincided with efforts of some Starbucks partners to seek union representation, which commenced in Buffalo, New York and has extended elsewhere in the country, impacting approximately 3% of Starbucks stores. Throughout this process, Starbucks has endeavored to comply with the law and we are committed to ensuring that it continue to do so. To the extent claims have been brought against Starbucks for violation of labor laws, the company has committed to defend itself where it believes the allegations are unfounded. To date, Starbucks has not been found to have violated the law as part of any enforced Order of the National Labor Relations Board."}

For example, the NLRB pursued injunctive relief in Federal Court in Arizona that the court denied, concluding that the NLRB did not have a likelihood of success on the merits, in part, because the NLRB premised its filing on testimony that was later found to be untrue. Likewise, an NLRB administrative law judge recently issued a decision in which the complaint filed by the NLRB General Counsel against Starbucks was dismissed. One NLRB official has reported to the agency's Inspector General that the agency's handling of Starbucks representation elections has been done in a way that is biased in favor of supporters of the union. This is contrary to the law, which confers upon employees the right to form, join, or assist a labor organization, or to refrain from doing so. The NLRB Inspector General has publicly announced his investigation into these reports.\n\nMoreover, where partners have selected a labor organization as their exclusive representative, Starbucks has committed to comply with the law and the rights of its partners to engage in collective bargaining.\n\nWhile we do not believe or agree that the independent, third-party assessment advanced by the proponent is necessary or in the best interest of Starbucks, its shareholders, or its partners, we recognize that Starbucks commitment to respect human rights within the framework of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights comes with the corresponding expectation that the company undertake human rights due diligence. Starbucks has commenced efforts to conduct a human rights impact assessment as a process to identify, assess, and address the company's most salient human rights impacts across the value chain. In developing the scope for the Starbucks human rights impact assessment, the company expects to prioritize salient human rights for deeper level review. To that end, labor rights principles outlined in the 1998 Declaration, including the principles of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, will be included in that process. As part of Starbucks commitment to transparency with respect to our global social and environmental impacts, we expect to make available the results of Starbucks human rights impact assessment to shareholders, stakeholders, and other interested parties. Recognizing that care must be taken when reporting on matters that are in active litigation because of privilege concerns, and recognizing that the proponents' proposal acknowledges that reality,\n\n82\n\nStarbucks expects to give due consideration to inclusion of labor rights where practicable and where such reporting does not adversely impact the company's litigation position.\n\nThe board of directors recommends that our shareholders vote against this proposal.\n\n## Board Recommendation\n\nThe board of directors recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal.\n\n2023 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n83\n\n# PROPOSAL 9\n\n# SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING CREATION OF BOARD COMMITTEE ON CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY\n\nRESOLVED\n\nShareholders of Starbucks request that the Board of Directors create a board committee on corporate sustainability to oversee and review the impact of the company's policy positions and advocacy on matters relating to the company's ongoing growth and sustainability.
