The succession planning team will also annually review with the board, our ceo succession planning process, including the identification, development, and progress of internal candidates and how candidates have been assessed.

For fiscal 2022, the types of goals and the weightings of such goals were unchanged from fiscal 2021. However, the Compensation Committee elected to refine the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan for fiscal 2022 by clarifying that the Individual Performance Factor (\"IPF\") portion of our Annual Incentive Bonus Plan for fiscal 2022 would be weighted at 30% in the aggregate. The IPF portion was limited to Mission and Values and strategic and operational goals specific to each individual participant (20% overall weighting), and inclusion and diversity goals whose achievement will vary by participant (10% overall weighting), while our planet- and profit-positive goals for fiscal 2022 were separate and distinct factors, with each having a 10% weighting and more formulaic payout metrics. Our planet-positive and profit-positive goals were applied consistently across the executive officer team.\n\nThe Annual Incentive Bonus Plan and the results of our fiscal 2022 performance are described in detail starting on page 47. While each of our NEOs who was eligible to earn an annual cash incentive award would have earned an award based on certain financial results and their individual performance, our Compensation Committee made a determination not to pay any such awards for fiscal 2022, given our overall earnings performance in fiscal 2022 and given that transformation efforts under our Reinvention Plan remain ongoing.\n\n## Leadership Stock Plan\n\nGiven the positive feedback received from shareholders in respect of our fiscal 2021 executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee did not make any changes to the Leadership Stock Plan for fiscal 2022. For fiscal 2022, long-term incentives were awarded in the form of: (1) PRSUs, where the number of shares earned is based on three-year EPS performance against pre-established annual targets, subject to a downward or upward adjustment of 25% based on relative TSR performance and an additional downward or upward adjustment of up to 10% based on achievement of inclusion and diversity goals and (2) time-based RSUs.

The ESG performance goals will comprise Inclusion & Diversity goals as well as sustainability goals, which will continue to be objective and quantitative to ensure clear, rigorous goal-setting with respect to our ESG strategies and objectives. The Committee also updated our Inclusion & Diversity metrics for fiscal 2023 to both remove complexity and provide more relevancy to our Inclusion & Diversity goals, providing a clearer and more impactful path for participants to drive our progress in our people-positive efforts. Further, the profit-positive goals that applied for fiscal 2022, which included operating margin, comparable store sales, and net new stores, were eliminated for fiscal 2023 as the Compensation Committee determined that the outcome of such metrics was largely reflected in the adjusted net revenue and adjusted operating income metrics and ultimately duplicative of the financial performance metrics under the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan.\n\nThe IPF component of the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan for fiscal 2023 will represent 15% of the overall Annual Incentive Bonus Plan payout (from 30% for fiscal 2022).

Johnson\n\nMr. Johnson retired from his position as president and chief executive officer and as a member of the board, effective April 4, 2022. To ensure an effective and smooth transition, Mr. Johnson continued to provide executive transition services through the end of fiscal 2022, and his base salary and annual bonus opportunity were reduced by 50% effective June 1, 2022, in proportion to the level of services he was expected to provide. Because Mr. Johnson was retirement eligible, his PRSUs and RSUs continued to vest under the terms of his existing award agreements. As discussed above, Mr. Johnson did not earn a cash incentive award, and he received the same payout of his fiscal 2019 PRSUs as other employees. In addition, Mr. Johnson's long-term cash performance-based award, which he was granted in December 2019, did not pay out as described above.\n\n## Separation of John Culver\n\nEffective October 1, 2022, we eliminated the chief operating officer role and Mr. Culver remained employed with the Company in a senior advisor role through January 1, 2023. Due to there no longer being an equivalent role for Mr. Culver, his employment was involuntarily terminated on January 2, 2023. Mr. Culver has executed a Separation Agreement and Release, which provided for the severance benefits set forth in our Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan in consideration for a release of claims in favor of Starbucks, and compliance with restrictive covenants, which included, among other provisions, compliance with non-solicitation, non-competition, and non-disparagement requirements."}

According to the International Labour Organization, \"Freedom of association refers to the right of workers to create and join organizations of their choice freely and without fear of reprisal or interference\" and collective bargaining \"allows workers to negotiate their working conditions freely with their employers.\"\n\nIn the U.S., many workers allege that Starbucks has interfered with these rights, including retaliation, intimidation, firings, captive audience meetings, store closings, undue surveillance, and illegally excluding unionized employees from wage and benefit increases-generating negative media coverage. Workers at hundreds of stores have voted to unionize, and regional offices of the National Labor Relations Board, after finding merit to hundreds of allegations of labor rights violations, have issued at least 20 complaints against Starbucks.2\n\nIn August 2022, a U.S. judge ordered Starbucks to reinstate seven Memphis, Tennessee employees who were allegedly fired for supporting an organizing campaign. 3 Also in August, the labor board requested that Howard Schultz read a notice to all employees informing them that some had been unlawfully denied benefits and pay increases.4\n\nWe believe the apparent misalignment between Starbucks' public commitments and its reported conduct represents material reputational, legal, and operational risks and may impact its long- term value. As Starbucks' 2021 10-K states \"our responses to any organizing efforts could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and have adverse effects on our business, including on our financial results.\" Failing to respect workers' rights could harm Starbucks reputation with consumers and hurt its ability to attract and retain a high-performing workforce, a crucial element of its ability to provide quality products and service. Research shows that union membership may have a positive effect on retention, in some cases, reducing resignations by as much as 65%.5 Studies show companies spend approximately 20% of an employee's salary to replace them.6\n\nGreater transparency on these issues could help address concerns about associated risks, and enable investors to perform human rights due diligence and assess Starbucks' adherence to its human rights commitments.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\t- https:/www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/04/new-york-starbucks-closed-union-drive; https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/business/economy/starbucks-union-howard-schultz\nnlrb.html\n\n- https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/starbucks-alleges-labor-board-misconduct-union-elections-us-cafes-2022-08-15;https://www.law360.com/employment-\nauthority/starbucks-tracker;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/06/starbucks-accused-of-more-than-200-labor-violations-in-nlrb-complaint.html https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/labor-\nboard-files-complaint-against-starbucks-for-withholding-raises-from-unionized-stores;https://www.nirb.gov/about-nlrb/what-we-do/investig\n\n\t- 3 s://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/starbucks-ordered-reinstate-workers-fired-amid-union-campaign-2022-08-184\n\n\t- 4 https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/business/economy/starbucks-union-howard-schultz-nlrb.html\n\n5\n\n- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226530917_The_Impact_of_Union_Membership_on_Intent_to_Leave_Additional_Evidence_on_the_Voice_Face_of_Union\n\n- 6 https://www.americanprogress.org/article/there-are-significant-business-costs-to-replacing-employees/"}

The board of directors also regularly discusses the Company's positions on matters significant to Starbucks, our operations, our partners, and our customers, including issues regarding public access to Starbucks stores.\n\nMoreover, our existing framework reflects our longstanding and unwavering commitment to corporate sustainability. Our annual Global Environmental and Social Impact (\"GESI\") Report details our efforts in corporate sustainability as they relate to our partners, highlighting the opportunities we offer, the work we do to foster a more inclusive workplace, and our various community initiatives and our commitment to the environment, offering insight into our strategies, goals, and progress. Our 2021 Civil Rights Assessment (CRA), which was conducted by a third-party, also details Starbucks commitment to sustaining Starbucks stores as a \"third place\" where customers feel welcome, fostering an internal culture of equity and inclusion, strengthening communities, and the importance of leadership.\n\nThe Proposal discusses the closure of 16 Starbucks stores due to safety concerns. We operate our network of over 9,200 company-operated stores in the U.S. with a focused commitment on creating a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment at each location. We continuously evaluate store locations and store closures as an ordinary part of our operations. During our 2022 fiscal year, we closed 116 U.S. company-operated stores for a variety of reasons, including, in some instances, safety. During that same period, we opened 437 new company-operated stores in the U.S. representing net store growth of 318 stores. The closure of 16 stores does not materially impact our business, but it does exemplify our commitment to the safety of our partners.\n\nAccordingly, because the Starbucks board of directors and its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee have effective oversight over sustainability issues and have disclosed our commitment to further our efforts with intention, transparency, and accountability publicly, including through the GESI Report and the CRA, the board of directors does not believe that establishing a separate corporate sustainability committee is necessary to properly exercise its oversight of this important area, nor would such a commitment add to Starbucks existing commitment to corporate sustainability.\n\nThe board of directors recommends that our shareholders vote against this proposal.\n\n## Board Recommendation\n\nThe board of directors recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal.\n\n2023 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n85"}
