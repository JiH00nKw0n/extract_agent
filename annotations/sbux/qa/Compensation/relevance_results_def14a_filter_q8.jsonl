Together with our partners, we have co-created a Reinvention plan that touches every aspect of the Starbucks Experience. For our customers, we are using technology to make their visits to our stores personalized and effortless, while also freeing up store partners to focus on creating more moments of connection. We are meeting them where they are, whether that's a Cold Brew on the go from a Pick-Up store, a quiet moment with a cappuccino inside one of our cafés, or a deep-dive into coffee education with a workshop at our new Starbucks Reserve location at the Empire State Building. For our partners, we are equipping them with better tools and training and have committed more than $1 billion in partner and store experience investments We are bringing coffee excellence, coffee craft, and joy and a little bit of love back into being a Starbucks barista.\n\nOver the past year, we have seen that the demand the prior year to a record $32.3 billion, driven by phenomenal 8 percent global growth in comparable store sales. Starbucks International continues to drive growth for the company, and we expect two-thirds of global retail growth over the next three years to come from our international business As we continue to navigate the COVID pandemic and its impacts in China, we are focused on supporting our partners and leaders in the market and look forward to a bright future ahead.\n\nOur impact at Starbucks ripples on a global scale. We take this responsibility seriously and strive to make a positive difference in the lives of the people we serve and the planet we share. We believe that every partner and every customer should have a sense of belonging at Starbucks, and should be able to be their authentic selves every day. We are dedicated to advancing racial and social equity, and we are committed to furthering that work with intention, transparency, and accountability. We are striving to be a resource-positive company, to give back more of the planet's resources than we consume. To help us get there, we have clear and ambitious sustainability targets to reduce our carbon, water, and waste footprints in half by 2030. Additionally, we are integrating sustainability throughout our Reinvention efforts, working to ensure we are considering the impacts to sustainability with each one of our strategies.\n\n## Onward\n\nThe new fiscal year also marks a new chapter with incoming ceo, Laxman Narasimhan. Since joining the company in October, he has been traveling around the world and immersing in our company and culture. Each day we have together, including time in Origin with our extended leadership team this Fall in Hacienda Alcasia, Costa Rica, we are reminded he is an extraordinary global citizen and servant leader who is embracing the vision of Starbucks in his own way.\n\nWe are both so proud of the company Starbucks is today and will be tomorrow, and profoundly grateful to the more than 400,000 Starbucks partners who are a part of this great odyssey. We would also like to extend our appreciation to the Starbucks Board of Directors for their leadership and support during this time of reinvention and renewal. We are laying the foundation for the future of a Starbucks even more true to our shared mission: To inspire and nurture the human spirit - one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.\n\nWith respect and gratitude,\n\n(hssignature21-\n04a.gif\n\nHoward Schultz\nchief executive officer\n\nMellody Hobson\nindependent chair of the board\n\n*Growth rate is based on a 52-week basis.

Annual EPS targets are measured and certified by the Compensation Committee each year. To reflect performance above or below target, adjusted EPS has a sliding scale that provides for payouts greater than the target number of PRSUs if performance results are greater than target (up to a maximum 200% of payout) or less than the target number if performance results are lower than target (down to a 25% payout for threshold performance below which\n\n52\n\nthe payout would be 0%).

Linear interpolation will be applied to performance that falls between EPS goals.\n\nTo the extent the performance targets are met, earned PRSUs generally vest 100% on the third anniversary of the grant date, with a possible adjustment upward or downward of 25% based on achievement of predetermined relative TSR goals and, with respect to fiscal 2022 PRSUs, a possible adjustment upward or downward of up to 10% based on achievement of predetermined inclusion and diversity goals.\n\nThe TSR metric will modify the fiscal 2022 PRSUs (as well our other outstanding PRSU grants) as follows: (i) upwards to a maximum of 125% if Starbucks TSR ranking is equal to or exceeds the 75th percentile, and (ii) downwards to a threshold of 75% if the Starbucks TSR ranking is equal to or below the 25th percentile, with linear interpolation to be applied if Starbucks TSR ranking is between the 25th and 75th percentile and above and below the 50th percentile.\n\n## RELATIVE TSR MODIFIER\n\n<table><tr><th>25th Percentile</th><th>50th Percentile</th><th>75th Percentile</th></tr><tr><td>75%</td><td>100%</td><td>125%</td></tr></table>\n\nThe representation metric will modify the fiscal 2022 PRSUs as follows: (i) upwards to a maximum of 110% if the inclusion and diversity goal of 5% representation growth is met or exceeded; (ii) reducing the number of PRSUs earned by 5% if the inclusion and diversity goal is not achieved but growth is positive and below 5%; and (iii) reducing the number of PRSUs earned by 10% if representation falls over the three-year performance period.\n\n## REPRESENTATION MODIFIER ¹\n\n<table><tr><th>&lt;0%</th><th>&gt;0% and &lt;5%</th><th>&gt;5%</th></tr><tr><td>90%</td><td>95%</td><td>110%</td></tr></table>\n\n(1) For improvement of representation of Black, Indigenous, and Latinx partners at the manager level and above.\n\nThe threshold, target, and maximum number of PRSUs that could have been earned by the NEOs are disclosed in the Fiscal 2022 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table on page 65.\n\n2023 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n53"}

The award was designed to retain Mr. Johnson in his role as president and ceo by providing compelling upside reward opportunity beyond the Company's regular executive compensation program for achieving exceptional shareholder returns. The award had a target value of $25 million but a payout under the award could only be earned if our relative TSR performance meaningfully outperformed the S&P 500 during the period beginning October 1, 2019, to September 30, 2022. Specifically, the award would have paid out at 100% of target if the Company's TSR performance relative to the companies comprising the S&P 500 index was at the 65th percentile, zero if performance was at the 40th percentile, and 200% of target if performance was at the 80th percentile, with linear interpolation between these points. At the end of fiscal 2022, Starbucks relative TSR was at the 25th percentile, resulting in no payout of the award.\n\n## Severance and CIC Plan\n\nIn August 2022, the Compensation Committee adopted the Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan (\"Severance and CIC Plan\") to facilitate the transformation and evolution of our executive leadership team and to align our executive compensation program more closely with market practices. Prior to adoption of the Severance and CIC Plan, we would from time-to-time offer severance benefit arrangements for terminated or separated executives as part of a negotiated termination of employment in exchange for a release of claims against the Company and other restrictive covenants. The Severance and CIC Plan was also adopted to provide uniformity and internal equity with respect to severance benefits among similarly situated executives and avoid protracted negotiations with departing executives.\n\nThe table below describes the material features of the Severance and CIC Plan and the Committee's rationale for the design of the Plan."}

The ESG performance goals will comprise Inclusion & Diversity goals as well as sustainability goals, which will continue to be objective and quantitative to ensure clear, rigorous goal-setting with respect to our ESG strategies and objectives. The Committee also updated our Inclusion & Diversity metrics for fiscal 2023 to both remove complexity and provide more relevancy to our Inclusion & Diversity goals, providing a clearer and more impactful path for participants to drive our progress in our people-positive efforts. Further, the profit-positive goals that applied for fiscal 2022, which included operating margin, comparable store sales, and net new stores, were eliminated for fiscal 2023 as the Compensation Committee determined that the outcome of such metrics was largely reflected in the adjusted net revenue and adjusted operating income metrics and ultimately duplicative of the financial performance metrics under the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan.\n\nThe IPF component of the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan for fiscal 2023 will represent 15% of the overall Annual Incentive Bonus Plan payout (from 30% for fiscal 2022). The IPF component will continue to be comprised of goals which are specific to each individual participant related to our Mission and Values, strategic and operational goals.\n\n## Retirement of Kevin R. Johnson\n\nMr. Johnson retired from his position as president and chief executive officer and as a member of the board, effective April 4, 2022. To ensure an effective and smooth transition, Mr. Johnson continued to provide executive transition services through the end of fiscal 2022, and his base salary and annual bonus opportunity were reduced by 50% effective June 1, 2022, in proportion to the level of services he was expected to provide. Because Mr. Johnson was retirement eligible, his PRSUs and RSUs continued to vest under the terms of his existing award agreements. As discussed above, Mr. Johnson did not earn a cash incentive award, and he received the same payout of his fiscal 2019 PRSUs as other employees. In addition, Mr. Johnson's long-term cash performance-based award, which he was granted in December 2019, did not pay out as described above.\n\n## Separation of John Culver\n\nEffective October 1, 2022, we eliminated the chief operating officer role and Mr. Culver remained employed with the Company in a senior advisor role through January 1, 2023. Due to there no longer being an equivalent role for Mr. Culver, his employment was involuntarily terminated on January 2, 2023. Mr. Culver has executed a Separation Agreement and Release, which provided for the severance benefits set forth in our Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan in consideration for a release of claims in favor of Starbucks, and compliance with restrictive covenants, which included, among other provisions, compliance with non-solicitation, non-competition, and non-disparagement requirements."}

We offer a comprehensive benefits package to all eligible full- and part-time partners in the U.S. and locally competitive benefits packages in other countries. In addition to our equity incentive plans discussed above, we offer an employee stock purchase plan to partners in the U.S. and Canada that allows participants to purchase Starbucks stock at a 5% discount to the fair market value at the end of each offering period under the plan. We believe our Total Rewards practices motivate our executives to build long-term shareholder value and reward the partners who take care of our customers.\n\n- Broad-Based \"Bean Stock\" Program: A long-term incentive grant of time-based RSUs was made in November 2021 to approximately 223,000 eligible non-executive partners in 21 markets around the world, including part-time partners. We refer to this broad-based equity program as our \"Bean Stock\" program. Bean Stock participants include those partners who work in our stores and serve our customers directly. In fiscal 2022, Bean Stock participants realized approximately $132 million in pre-tax gains from previously granted Bean Stock awards.\n\n- Future Roast 401(k) Savings Plan: Available to all U.S. partners who are at least age 18 with 90 days of service. The Starbucks Match within the 401(k) is 100% of the first 5% of eligible compensation contributed each pay period. The match is immediately fully vested and is contributed to each participant's 401(k) account each pay period along with the participant's contributions. In fiscal 2022, Starbucks contributed more than $146 million in matching contributions.\n\n- Insurance Coverage for Partners: For more than 30 years, Starbucks has provided health insurance coverage for partners working 20 hours or more a week. Starbucks also provides life and disability insurance to eligible partners.\n\n- College Achievement Plan: The Starbucks College Achievement Plan was launched in fiscal 2014. It provides eligible partners in the U.S. with the opportunity to earn a first-time bachelor's degree online from Arizona State University with 100% upfront tuition coverage. Additionally, our military service member and Veteran partners can extend an additional Starbucks College Achievement Plan benefit to a qualifying family member of their choice. As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023, nearly 10,000 partners had graduated with degrees, and more than 23,000 partners were participating in the Starbucks College Achievement Plan.\n\n- Paid Sick Time, Vacation, Holiday, and Parental Leave: Starbucks is an industry leader in paid sick time and parental leave and has competitive policies for vacation and holiday pay.\n\n- Partner Assistance: Our CUP Fund gives financial assistance to Starbucks partners in times of special need due to illness, death in the family, natural disasters, or other extreme circumstances.\n\n- Partner Financial Well Being: My Starbucks Savings enables eligible partners to save directly from their paycheck for emergencies and other financial needs. Starbucks provides an incentive to eligible partners at key milestones in their savings journey. Starbucks Student Loan Management program provides a platform for eligible Starbucks partners to manage their student loans.
