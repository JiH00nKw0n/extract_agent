Our commitment to transparency, intentionality, and accountability underpins all our efforts to share extensive data on our progress against our ambitious ESG goals, business practices, work in sustainability, and our commitment to the communities we serve. As part of that commitment, since 2001, Starbucks has proactively published the Global Environmental & Social Impact report, an annual fiscal year update on key ESG programs and progress.\n\nWe promote ethical leadership and business practices to deliver our very best in all we do, while holding ourselves accountable for results. Our board and its committees are responsible for overseeing the effectiveness of our global environmental and social impact strategy. We govern our sustainability commitments through the Global Environmental Council, which is comprised of senior leaders across Starbucks whose compensation is tied to performance against our goals. We continue to implement an executive compensation program that includes benchmarks for achieving sustainability goals and building inclusive and diverse teams. All Starbucks partners are governed by internal policies addressing ethics and human rights issues, including Anti- Harassment, Anti-Discrimination, Conflicts of Interest, Gifts & Entertainment, Anti-Bribery, and Equal Employment Opportunity. And, we practice rigorous data collection, including third-party data verification, to ensure our reporting is accurate and representative of the great strides we are making to support our partners, customers, communities, and planet.\n\nStarbucks is also committed to being a force for global good by advancing equity and civic engagement so our partners can share their vision for stronger communities In the U.S., we provide tools and resources for partners to ensure their voice is heard in each and every election. Globally, we work with partners, licensees, and business partners to advocate for policies that support our partners, the health of our business and the communities we serve through the lens of our Mission and Values.\n\nStarbucks is building on over 50 years of great business through the lens of humanity to a future of exceptional service-service to our partners, service to our customers, and service to our planet. We believe this focus will support the success of our business and drive value for our shareholders as we continue to pursue our strategic priorities.\n\n- 1 Additional programmatic updates and performance against these priorities and publicly stated goals will be shared in Starbucks forthcoming FY22 Global Environmental and Social Impact Report.\n\n2\n\n- Starbucks.

At our 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. approximately 92.4% of our shareholders who cast votes supported our advisory vote on executive compensation. In addition, every year, we engage with shareholders representing a significant portion of our outstanding shares on a variety of topics, including our executive compensation program. During 2022, as part of our regular shareholder outreach, we engaged with our top shareholders, representing nearly 30% of our total shares outstanding. The shareholders with whom we engaged generally expressed support for our executive compensation program, and were also supportive of the meaningful enhancements that we made to our program in fiscal 2022, which included, among other things, clarifying that the non-financial individual performance factor portion of our Annual Incentive Bonus Plan would be weighted at 30% in the aggregate, and providing for more formulaic payout metrics for ESG goals.\n\nIn evaluating our compensation practices for fiscal 2023, the Compensation Committee was mindful of the feedback provided by shareholders and continued to refine our Annual Incentive Bonus Plan to more closely align compensation with company financial performance and further demonstrate our commitment to value creation for shareholders, including an increased focus on sales and earnings given the effects of COVID-19, supply chain and materials costs, potential difficulties in China, and the Company's transformation in connection with our Reinvention Plan. Beginning with the fiscal 2023 Annual Incentive Bonus Plan, 70% of each participant's target incentive opportunity will be earned based on adjusted net revenue and adjusted operating income financial metrics, increased from 50% and the remaining 30% will be earned based on ESG metrics (15% increased from 10% in fiscal 2022) and individual performance (15% decreased from 30% in fiscal 2022). Profit specific goals, which included operating margin, comparable store sales, and net new stores, were eliminated from the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan as the Compensation Committee determined that performance against these metrics was largely reflected in the adjusted net revenue and adjusted operating income metrics and wanted to focus and simplify the plan, as described in more detail below in the section entitled \"2023 Executive Compensation.\"\n\n2023 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n41\n\n## Fiscal 2022 Target Total Direct Compensation\n\nThe vast majority of our NEOs' target total direct compensation is in the form of compensation that is variable or \"at-risk\" based on our financial, operating, and ESG performance and the value of our stock price. The at-risk elements of our fiscal 2022 program include (i) our Annual Incentive Bonus Plan, an annual cash incentive award program, and (ii) our Leadership Stock Plan, through which PRSUs and RSUs were granted as long-term incentive awards.\n\nFORMER CEO\nCompensation Mix*\n\nbarchart_compensationmixx1.jpg\n\nOther NEOs* **\nCompensation Mix\n\n(barchart_cmixx2a.jpg\n\n.\n\n- The chart above does not include Mr. Schultz, who, in connection with his appointment as interim chief executive officer, received a base salary of only $1, was not eligible to earn an annual cash incentive award under the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan, and did not receive any equity award grants.\n\n** This chart also does not include Mr. Narasimhan, who did not commence employment with the Company until October 1, 2022, the day immediately preceding the end of fiscal 2022.\n\n# Rigorous Goal Setting\n\nOur management and the Committee worked collaboratively to set targets reflective of our ambitious performance goals and to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders.\n\n## 2022 Annual Incentive Bonus Plan\n\n## Leadership Stock Plan\n\nThe three radial slices shown here are not meant to be representative of their categorical value."}

Base salaries, annual cash incentive payments (for performance in the prior fiscal year), performance goals for annual cash incentive awards, and long-term equity grants are approved after the end of each fiscal year at the Committee's November meeting. This process allows the Compensation Committee to consider comprehensive information, including the performance of each NEO during the prior fiscal year, when making final compensation decisions.\n\n## Management's Role in the Executive\nCompensation Process\n\nOur ceo, along with key members of our human resources function (\"Partner Resources\") and our Law & Corporate Affairs Department each help support the Compensation Committee's executive compensation process and regularly attend portions of the Committee's meetings. As part of the executive compensation process, our ceo provides his perspective to the Compensation Committee regarding the performance of his executive leadership team, which includes all our executive officers and certain other senior officers of the Company. Members of the Partner Resources team present recommendations to the Compensation Committee on the full range of annual executive compensation decisions, including (i) annual and long-term incentive compensation plans, (ii) target competitive positioning of executive compensation, and (iii) target total direct compensation for each executive officer. These recommendations are developed in consultation with our ceo (except with regard to his own compensation) and are supported by market data.\n\n## The Role of Consultants in the Executive Compensation\nProcess\n\nBeginning in September 2021, the Compensation Committee engaged Pay Governance as its outside independent compensation consultant The Compensation Committee's consultant regularly attends committee meetings and attends executive sessions as requested by the Compensation Committee's chair. During fiscal 2022, Pay Governance did not perform any services for Starbucks other than advising on executive compensation and non-employee director compensation under its engagement by the Compensation Committee. Pay Governance's tasks also included reviewing, validating, and providing input on information, programs, and recommendations made by management.\n\n## At-Risk Compensation\n\nA core principle of our executive compensation program is that a large majority of compensation awarded to our NEOs, especially to our ceo, be variable, performance-based or \"at-risk.\" This type of compensation is primarily dependent on the financial success of our Company and the performance of Starbucks common stock. This means that our executives are rewarded when they produce value for our shareholders and our partners. Elements of our fiscal 2022 program that fall within this category include annual cash incentive awards, PRSUs, and RSUs.\n\n## Internal Pay Equity\n\nThe Compensation Committee considers internal pay equity, among other factors, when making compensation decisions. However, the Compensation Committee does not use a fixed ratio or formula when comparing compensation among executive officers. The Compensation Committee believes that a failure to maintain an appropriate balance in the pay levels among members of our executive leadership team creates inappropriate business risks."}

The Company has had annual votes starting with the 2012 annual meeting, following the advisory vote of shareholders in favor of annual \"say on pay\" votes, which was reaffirmed at the Company's 2017 annual meeting.\n\nWhile the Company's executive compensation programs are designed to promote a long-term connection between pay and performance, the board recognizes that executive compensation disclosures are made annually. Holding an annual advisory vote on executive compensation provides the Company with more direct and immediate feedback on our compensation disclosures. We believe that an annual advisory vote on executive compensation is consistent with our practice of seeking input and engaging in dialogue with our shareholders on corporate governance matters (including the Company's practice of having all directors elected annually and annually providing shareholders the opportunity to ratify the Audit Committee's selection of independent auditors) and our executive compensation philosophy, policies and practices.\n\nAlthough the vote is non-binding, the board will consider the vote results in determining the frequency of future say-on-pay votes. The Company will announce its decision on the frequency of say-on-pay votes in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC no later than 150 days after the Annual Meeting. Notwithstanding the board's recommendation and the outcome of the shareholder vote, the board may in the future decide to conduct advisory votes on a more or less frequent basis and may vary its practice based on factors such as discussions with shareholders and the adoptions of material changes to compensation programs.\n\n## Board Recommendation\n\nThe board of directors recommends a vote to conduct future advisory votes on executive compensation EVERY YEAR.\n\n72\n\nPROPOSAL 4"}

Our aim is to provide our customers with a variety of food and beverage choices in addition to sustainable dairy, and we have collaborated with plant-based innovators so that today nearly all stores across our markets offer plant-based food and beverage menu items. We continue to introduce new drinks and food items to menus while innovating with plant-based ingredients across key platforms like espresso, cold brew, refreshers, and food to meet growing customer demand globally. Since the beginning of our 2022 fiscal year, we have launched three new beverage innovations featuring plant-based milk, including the Iced Sugar Cookie Almond Milk Latte offered as part of our holiday 2022 menu.\n\nOur recent plant-based beverage innovations build on our demonstrated track record of providing customers with more choices. We began offering plant-based milk to customers in the U.S. in 1997 when we added soymilk to menus As non-dairy beverages grew in popularity, we added coconut milk in 2015, almond milk in 2016, and expanded to offer oat milk nationally in 2021. We continue to innovate to expand plant-based menus and use technology to support greater adoption for plant-based options. In April 2021, in partnership with Arizona State University, we announced the ASU-Starbucks Center for the Future of People and the Planet, which focuses on initiatives aimed to deliver scalable impact towards our aspirational sustainability goals for 2030 and beyond. To empower customers and to promote environmental practices, the Center is exploring\n\n75"}
