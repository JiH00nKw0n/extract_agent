Our commitment to transparency, intentionality, and accountability underpins all our efforts to share extensive data on our progress against our ambitious ESG goals, business practices, work in sustainability, and our commitment to the communities we serve. As part of that commitment, since 2001, Starbucks has proactively published the Global Environmental & Social Impact report, an annual fiscal year update on key ESG programs and progress.\n\nWe promote ethical leadership and business practices to deliver our very best in all we do, while holding ourselves accountable for results. Our board and its committees are responsible for overseeing the effectiveness of our global environmental and social impact strategy. We govern our sustainability commitments through the Global Environmental Council, which is comprised of senior leaders across Starbucks whose compensation is tied to performance against our goals. We continue to implement an executive compensation program that includes benchmarks for achieving sustainability goals and building inclusive and diverse teams. All Starbucks partners are governed by internal policies addressing ethics and human rights issues, including Anti- Harassment, Anti-Discrimination, Conflicts of Interest, Gifts & Entertainment, Anti-Bribery, and Equal Employment Opportunity. And, we practice rigorous data collection, including third-party data verification, to ensure our reporting is accurate and representative of the great strides we are making to support our partners, customers, communities, and planet.\n\nStarbucks is also committed to being a force for global good by advancing equity and civic engagement so our partners can share their vision for stronger communities In the U.S., we provide tools and resources for partners to ensure their voice is heard in each and every election. Globally, we work with partners, licensees, and business partners to advocate for policies that support our partners, the health of our business and the communities we serve through the lens of our Mission and Values.\n\nStarbucks is building on over 50 years of great business through the lens of humanity to a future of exceptional service-service to our partners, service to our customers, and service to our planet. We believe this focus will support the success of our business and drive value for our shareholders as we continue to pursue our strategic priorities.\n\n- 1 Additional programmatic updates and performance against these priorities and publicly stated goals will be shared in Starbucks forthcoming FY22 Global Environmental and Social Impact Report.\n\n2\n\n- Starbucks.

In addition, every year, we engage with shareholders representing a significant portion of our outstanding shares on a variety of topics, including our executive compensation program. During 2022, as part of our regular shareholder outreach, we engaged with our top shareholders, representing nearly 30% of our total shares outstanding. The shareholders with whom we engaged generally expressed support for our executive compensation program, and were also supportive of the meaningful enhancements that we made to our program in fiscal 2022, which included, among other things, clarifying that the non-financial individual performance factor portion of our Annual Incentive Bonus Plan would be weighted at 30% in the aggregate, and providing for more formulaic payout metrics for ESG goals.\n\nIn evaluating our compensation practices for fiscal 2023, the Compensation Committee was mindful of the feedback provided by shareholders and continued to refine our Annual Incentive Bonus Plan to more closely align compensation with company financial performance and further demonstrate our commitment to value creation for shareholders, including an increased focus on sales and earnings given the effects of COVID-19, supply chain and materials costs, potential difficulties in China, and the Company's transformation in connection with our Reinvention Plan.

The representation metric will operate as a modifier to the payout of the fiscal 2022 PRSU award.\n\nAnnual EPS performance targets are set each year and then averaged at the conclusion of the three-year performance period to determine baseline payouts from 0-200% and three-year relative TSR performance is measured against the S&P 500.

Annual EPS targets are measured and certified by the Compensation Committee each year. To reflect performance above or below target, adjusted EPS has a sliding scale that provides for payouts greater than the target number of PRSUs if performance results are greater than target (up to a maximum 200% of payout) or less than the target number if performance results are lower than target (down to a 25% payout for threshold performance below which\n\n52\n\nthe payout would be 0%).

Because Mr. Johnson was retirement eligible, his PRSUs and RSUs continued to vest under the terms of his existing award agreements.
