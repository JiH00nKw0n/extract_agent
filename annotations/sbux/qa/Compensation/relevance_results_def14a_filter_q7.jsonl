We invest in our partners because we know that when we put them first-and work to exceed their expectations-the result is a great experience for our customers and communities.

In the U.S., those benefits include comprehensive health coverage, mental health benefits, retirement plans with company match, Bean Stock, our equity reward program, 100 percent tuition coverage for a first-time bachelor's degree and more.3\n\nStarbucks took significant action in fiscal 2022 to improve our partners' experience through increased wages, additional training, and comprehensive benefits. Our wage increases and training program expansion for U.S. retail partners in fiscal 2022 totaled $1 billion, and we updated our family expansion reimbursement benefit, while also introducing access to financial well-being tools and the opportunity to accrue sick time at a faster rate.\n\nStarbucks effort to improve our partners' experience is founded on a deep commitment to advance inclusion, diversity, and equity-and the belief that we are at our best when we create inclusive and welcoming environments, where we uplift one another with dignity, respect, and kindness We are committed to hiring from communities that may face barriers to employment, including people of color, Veterans and military spouses; people who are in LGBTQIA+ communities; and those who are disabled. Starbucks aims to achieve and maintain gender pay equity in all global company-operated markets annually, in addition to racial pay equity in the United States. We commit to transparent data collection and reporting on our hiring practices, partner demographics, and partner support initiatives to hold us accountable as we continue to build a diverse and inclusive company. For example, Starbucks began publishing regular Civil Rights Assessments4 in 2019 to address our progress and present recommendations for reaching new heights in our work to develop and sustain an inclusive, diverse workforce."}

PRSUs are earned only to the extent pre-established performance goals are met. Time-based RSUs vest annually in equal installments of 25%, commencing on the first anniversary of the grant date. Both PRSUs and time-based RSUs include dividend equivalent rights payable at the same time as the underlying shares are earned.\n\nThe values of the long-term incentive awards reflected in the table below were designed to be competitive to market, recognize the personal performance of each executive in the fiscal year prior to the November grant date (as applicable), and to further increase the percentage of total pay that is variable and at-risk based on Starbucks financial, shareholder return, and inclusion and diversity performance. The table below reflects the value of annual long-term incentive awards approved by the Committee for our NEOs in each of the last two fiscal years under the Leadership Stock Plan, other than Mr. Schultz who did not receive any equity grants in fiscal 2022 or Mr. Narasimhan who did not receive any annual long-term incentive awards in fiscal 2022 but instead received the replacement grants described above in \"ceo-Elect New Hire Package.\" We determined the number of PRSUs to be delivered by dividing 60% of the value approved by the Committee by the closing price of our stock on the grant date. For time-based RSUs, we divided 40% of the value by the closing price of our stock on the grant date.

Target total direct compensation is designed to be competitive with peer companies and market data, as explained below under Peer Group Companies and Benchmarking\n\nThe Compensation Committee typically reviews target total direct compensation and approves the target value of annual cash incentive awards (as a percentage of base salary) annually at its November meeting following the conclusion of the fiscal year. Base salaries, annual cash incentive payments (for performance in the prior fiscal year), performance goals for annual cash incentive awards, and long-term equity grants are approved after the end of each fiscal year at the Committee's November meeting. This process allows the Compensation Committee to consider comprehensive information, including the performance of each NEO during the prior fiscal year, when making final compensation decisions.\n\n## Management's Role in the Executive\nCompensation Process\n\nOur ceo, along with key members of our human resources function (\"Partner Resources\") and our Law & Corporate Affairs Department each help support the Compensation Committee's executive compensation process and regularly attend portions of the Committee's meetings. As part of the executive compensation process, our ceo provides his perspective to the Compensation Committee regarding the performance of his executive leadership team, which includes all our executive officers and certain other senior officers of the Company. Members of the Partner Resources team present recommendations to the Compensation Committee on the full range of annual executive compensation decisions, including (i) annual and long-term incentive compensation plans, (ii) target competitive positioning of executive compensation, and (iii) target total direct compensation for each executive officer. These recommendations are developed in consultation with our ceo (except with regard to his own compensation) and are supported by market data.\n\n## The Role of Consultants in the Executive Compensation\nProcess\n\nBeginning in September 2021, the Compensation Committee engaged Pay Governance as its outside independent compensation consultant The Compensation Committee's consultant regularly attends committee meetings and attends executive sessions as requested by the Compensation Committee's chair. During fiscal 2022, Pay Governance did not perform any services for Starbucks other than advising on executive compensation and non-employee director compensation under its engagement by the Compensation Committee. Pay Governance's tasks also included reviewing, validating, and providing input on information, programs, and recommendations made by management.\n\n## At-Risk Compensation\n\nA core principle of our executive compensation program is that a large majority of compensation awarded to our NEOs, especially to our ceo, be variable, performance-based or \"at-risk.\" This type of compensation is primarily dependent on the financial success of our Company and the performance of Starbucks common stock. This means that our executives are rewarded when they produce value for our shareholders and our partners. Elements of our fiscal 2022 program that fall within this category include annual cash incentive awards, PRSUs, and RSUs.\n\n## Internal Pay Equity\n\nThe Compensation Committee considers internal pay equity, among other factors, when making compensation decisions.

We offer a comprehensive benefits package to all eligible full- and part-time partners in the U.S. and locally competitive benefits packages in other countries. In addition to our equity incentive plans discussed above, we offer an employee stock purchase plan to partners in the U.S. and Canada that allows participants to purchase Starbucks stock at a 5% discount to the fair market value at the end of each offering period under the plan. We believe our Total Rewards practices motivate our executives to build long-term shareholder value and reward the partners who take care of our customers.\n\n- Broad-Based \"Bean Stock\" Program: A long-term incentive grant of time-based RSUs was made in November 2021 to approximately 223,000 eligible non-executive partners in 21 markets around the world, including part-time partners. We refer to this broad-based equity program as our \"Bean Stock\" program. Bean Stock participants include those partners who work in our stores and serve our customers directly. In fiscal 2022, Bean Stock participants realized approximately $132 million in pre-tax gains from previously granted Bean Stock awards.\n\n- Future Roast 401(k) Savings Plan: Available to all U.S. partners who are at least age 18 with 90 days of service. The Starbucks Match within the 401(k) is 100% of the first 5% of eligible compensation contributed each pay period. The match is immediately fully vested and is contributed to each participant's 401(k) account each pay period along with the participant's contributions. In fiscal 2022, Starbucks contributed more than $146 million in matching contributions.\n\n- Insurance Coverage for Partners: For more than 30 years, Starbucks has provided health insurance coverage for partners working 20 hours or more a week. Starbucks also provides life and disability insurance to eligible partners.\n\n- College Achievement Plan: The Starbucks College Achievement Plan was launched in fiscal 2014. It provides eligible partners in the U.S. with the opportunity to earn a first-time bachelor's degree online from Arizona State University with 100% upfront tuition coverage. Additionally, our military service member and Veteran partners can extend an additional Starbucks College Achievement Plan benefit to a qualifying family member of their choice. As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023, nearly 10,000 partners had graduated with degrees, and more than 23,000 partners were participating in the Starbucks College Achievement Plan.\n\n- Paid Sick Time, Vacation, Holiday, and Parental Leave: Starbucks is an industry leader in paid sick time and parental leave and has competitive policies for vacation and holiday pay.\n\n- Partner Assistance: Our CUP Fund gives financial assistance to Starbucks partners in times of special need due to illness, death in the family, natural disasters, or other extreme circumstances.\n\n- Partner Financial Well Being: My Starbucks Savings enables eligible partners to save directly from their paycheck for emergencies and other financial needs. Starbucks provides an incentive to eligible partners at key milestones in their savings journey. Starbucks Student Loan Management program provides a platform for eligible Starbucks partners to manage their student loans. Both programs were launched in September 2022.\n\nThe above benefits specifically apply in the U.S., but we generally strive to provide similar benefits in all countries while considering the social coverage programs available in each country.\n\nExecutives are eligible to participate in all benefit plans we offer to partners generally. This helps us attract and retain top executive talent."}

All equity awards shown in this table were granted under the 2005 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan.

The final number of PRSUs earned also will be based on achievement of an EPS goal, a relative TSR modifier, and a representation modifier as further discussed in the Leadership Stock Plan section of the CD&A beginning on page 52.

The plan is subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. We maintain a trust agreement with an independent trustee establishing a rabbi trust for the purpose of funding benefits payable to participants (including NEOs) under our MDCP in the event of a change in control. It is currently funded with a nominal amount of cash.\n\nDeferrals. Participants may defer up to 70% of base salary to the MDCP and up to 85% of bonuses paid under certain eligible annual incentive bonus plans. Bonus deferral elections are available only to those who are eligible and enroll during the annual enrollment window that takes place prior to the start of each fiscal year. We do not provide matching contributions on participant MDCP deferrals.\n\nEarnings. The MDCP uses measurement benchmarks to credit earnings on compensation deferred under the plan. Those measurement benchmarks are based on the same funds available under our 401(k) plan. Participants choose how to allocate their account balance among the measurement funds and may change how current deferred compensation is allocated at any time, subject to certain redemption fees and other limitations imposed by frequent trading restrictions and plan rules. Changes generally become effective as of the first trading day following the change."}

At the time of making the deferral election for a particular year, a participant elects when the associated deferred compensation will be distributed. In general, the participant can receive scheduled \"in-service\" withdrawals or hardship withdrawals while still employed or have distributions paid upon separation from service. The specific distribution options depend on whether the deferred compensation was earned before or after January 1, 2005, and is subject to other plan rules.\n\nFor separation from service distributions, account balances resulting from the Company match and deferred compensation earned on and after January 1, 2005, can be paid either in a lump sum or in up to 10 annual installments, in each case beginning within 60 days or one year after separation from service. For partners who became newly eligible on or after October 1, 2010, and certain other partners, separation from service distributions can be paid either in a lump sum or amortized over a period of two to five years, in each case beginning within 60 days or one year after separation from service. If a participant is considered a \"specified employee\" on their separation date, Section 409A requires that the payments be delayed for six months after such separation date. Account balances resulting from pre-2005 deferred compensation can be distributed either in a lump sum within 60 days of separation or, if the participant is at least age 65 on their separation date, in up to 10 annual installments. Retirement age under the MDCP is age 65, and no current NEO with an MDCP balance was retirement eligible under the MDCP during fiscal 2022.\n\n68"}
