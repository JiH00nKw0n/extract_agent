The results are shared with our partners and reviewed by senior leadership, who analyze areas of progress or deterioration and prioritize actions and activities in response to this feedback to drive meaningful improvements in partner engagement. Our management and cross-functional teams also work closely to evaluate human capital management issues such as partner retention, workplace safety, harassment and bullying, as well as to implement measures to mitigate these risks.\n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nWe are committed to creating a welcoming, supportive and inclusive environment. We are committed to advancing inclusion and racial and social equity, and we seek to further that work with intention, transparency and accountability. We continue to welcome our partners, customers, civil rights and community leaders, along with our senior vice president, talent and inclusion, to advise us along this journey.\n\nStarbucks has made specific equity commitments based on our principles of being intentional, transparent and accountable at all levels:\n\n•Being intentional in cultivating a culture of inclusion, with a focus on partner retention and development.\n\n◦Expanding our mentorship program designed to prioritize our partners’ sense of belonging by creating an inclusive and supportive environment. Mentors offer guidance, encouragement and a safe space for partners to share their experiences, challenges and aspirations. As of 2023, the program has welcomed nearly 1,400 partners and was expanded to include U.S. based store and district managers in 2023.\n\n•Being transparent in our approach to Inclusion and Diversity goal setting and progress.\n\n◦Publicly sharing workforce diversity data.\n\n◦Setting aspirational Inclusion and Diversity goals based on retention rates and progress towards achieving racial and ethnic diversity. Our goal is to achieve racial and ethnic diversity of at least 30% of all corporate roles and at least 40% of all retail and manufacturing roles in the U.S. by 2025, by setting broad recruiting parameters and through inclusive and legally compliant employment practices.\n\n•Holding ourselves accountable at the highest levels of the organization.\n\n◦Incorporating our efforts to build and retain inclusive and diverse teams into our executive compensation programs.\n\n◦Joining the Board Diversity Action Alliance to act alongside other companies similarly committed to increasing diverse representation on corporate boards.\n\n◦Publicizing self-identified race/ethnicity/gender of each member of our Board.\n\nTotal Rewards\n\nWe have demonstrated a history of investing in our workforce by offering competitive salaries and wages by continuously assessing the current business environment and labor market. We have consistently made enhancements in wages in order to attract talent to support our growth strategy and to elevate the customer experience. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of partners with shareholders, restricted stock units are provided to eligible non-executive partners under our broad-based stock incentive programs. Furthermore, we offer comprehensive, locally relevant and innovative benefits to all eligible partners. In the U.S., our largest and most mature market, these include:\n\n•Comprehensive health insurance coverage is offered to partners working an average of 20 hours or more each week.\n\n•100% upfront tuition coverage through the Starbucks College Achievement Plan for partners to earn a first-time bachelor's degree online at Arizona State University is offered to partners working an average of 20 hours or more each week.\n\n•Our Future Roast 401(k) savings plan helps partners save for their financial goal through convenient payroll deductions. Partners can contribute pre-tax or Roth after-tax dollars, and Starbucks matches 5% of eligible contributions with immediate vesting in those matching contributions.\n\n•100% paid parental leave is available to new parents that welcome a child through birth, adoption or foster placement and work an average of 20 hours or more each week.\n\n•A Partner and Family Sick Time program is provided and allows partners to accrue paid sick time based on hours worked and use that time for themselves or family members in need of care.\n\n4"}

Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $25.6 million and $26.1 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $110.3 million and $104.7 million, respectively.\n\nStock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return and metrics focused on building inclusive and diverse teams. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and our historical experience. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. If applicable, our total shareholder return relative to our peer group is incorporated into the underlying assumptions using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to calculate grant date fair value. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award, and only for those awards expected to vest, with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant based on our historical experience and future expectations.\n\nForeign Currency Translation\n\nOur international operations generally use their local currency as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe compute income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income taxes are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred taxes is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\n\nWe routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdictions from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.\n\nIn addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the\n\n56"}
