Our fiscal 2020 PRSUs (awarded in November 2019) paid out at only 61.25% due to our inability to achieve the rigorous earnings targets and our total shareholder return performance compared to the S&P 500 during the last three fiscal years.

The representation metric will operate as a modifier to the payout of the fiscal 2022 PRSU award.\n\nAnnual EPS performance targets are set each year and then averaged at the conclusion of the three-year performance period to determine baseline payouts from 0-200% and three-year relative TSR performance is measured against the S&P 500. The PRSUs granted in fiscal 2022 reflect this structure and represent 60% of target long-term award value for fiscal 2022.\n\nThe extent to which PRSUs are earned is based on our achievement of annual adjusted EPS, relative TSR goals measured over a three-year period following the grant date, and, with respect to fiscal 2022 PRSUs, achievement of inclusion and diversity goals. Annual EPS targets are measured and certified by the Compensation Committee each year. To reflect performance above or below target, adjusted EPS has a sliding scale that provides for payouts greater than the target number of PRSUs if performance results are greater than target (up to a maximum 200% of payout) or less than the target number if performance results are lower than target (down to a 25% payout for threshold performance below which\n\n52\n\nthe payout would be 0%).

During fiscal 2022, Pay Governance did not perform any services for Starbucks other than advising on executive compensation and non-employee director compensation under its engagement by the Compensation Committee. Pay Governance's tasks also included reviewing, validating, and providing input on information, programs, and recommendations made by management.\n\n## At-Risk Compensation\n\nA core principle of our executive compensation program is that a large majority of compensation awarded to our NEOs, especially to our ceo, be variable, performance-based or \"at-risk.\" This type of compensation is primarily dependent on the financial success of our Company and the performance of Starbucks common stock. This means that our executives are rewarded when they produce value for our shareholders and our partners. Elements of our fiscal 2022 program that fall within this category include annual cash incentive awards, PRSUs, and RSUs.\n\n## Internal Pay Equity\n\nThe Compensation Committee considers internal pay equity, among other factors, when making compensation decisions. However, the Compensation Committee does not use a fixed ratio or formula when comparing compensation among executive officers. The Compensation Committee believes that a failure to maintain an appropriate balance in the pay levels among members of our executive leadership team creates inappropriate business risks."}

The Compensation Committee generally sets target total direct compensation for our executives to be competitive with peer companies and other market data and takes into consideration scope of job responsibilities, individual performance of the executive, and other factors. The Compensation Committee's executive compensation determinations are based on its review of such factors and are informed by the experiences of the members of the Compensation Committee as well as input from, and peer group data provided by, the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant\n\nThe market data considered by the Committee as part of the annual pay-setting process reflects compensation levels and practices for executives holding comparable positions at peer group companies and includes broader compensation survey data.\n\nThe Compensation Committee, with assistance from its independent compensation consultant, annually reviews the composition of our peer group. As part of such reviews, the Committee considers specific criteria and recommendations regarding companies to add or remove from the peer group. The industries from which we select our peer group companies consist of consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and information technology-software and services companies. From those industries, the Committee selected a peer group that includes global companies with complex management needs and strong brand profiles. For fiscal 2022, the Committee modified the 2021 peer group by removing The Home Depot, Inc. and Yum! Brands, Inc., and adding Kimberly-Clark Corporation and Mondelez International, Inc.\n\nThe Compensation Committee and independent directors considered the peer group in connection with their fiscal 2022 target total direct compensation decisions.

As such, for fiscal 2023, financial performance results will represent 70% of the overall Annual Incentive Bonus Plan payout (compared to 50% for fiscal 2022), with 30% and 40% weighting for total Company revenue and operating income goals, respectively (compared to 20% and 30% for fiscal 2022). The chart on the next page sets forth the updated components of the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan for fiscal 2023 and their relative weights as compared to the plan design for fiscal 2022. In addition, financial revenue and operating income performance metrics for all participants in the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan, regardless of position, will be aligned to total Company financial performance for fiscal 2023, which will ensure more uniformity and consistency in the way that total Company financial performance goals apply to all participants and will further align the invaluable efforts of our partners with the overall success of the Company.\n\n2023 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n57"}

The ESG performance goals will comprise Inclusion & Diversity goals as well as sustainability goals, which will continue to be objective and quantitative to ensure clear, rigorous goal-setting with respect to our ESG strategies and objectives. The Committee also updated our Inclusion & Diversity metrics for fiscal 2023 to both remove complexity and provide more relevancy to our Inclusion & Diversity goals, providing a clearer and more impactful path for participants to drive our progress in our people-positive efforts. Further, the profit-positive goals that applied for fiscal 2022, which included operating margin, comparable store sales, and net new stores, were eliminated for fiscal 2023 as the Compensation Committee determined that the outcome of such metrics was largely reflected in the adjusted net revenue and adjusted operating income metrics and ultimately duplicative of the financial performance metrics under the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan.\n\nThe IPF component of the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan for fiscal 2023 will represent 15% of the overall Annual Incentive Bonus Plan payout (from 30% for fiscal 2022). The IPF component will continue to be comprised of goals which are specific to each individual participant related to our Mission and Values, strategic and operational goals.\n\n## Retirement of Kevin R. Johnson\n\nMr. Johnson retired from his position as president and chief executive officer and as a member of the board, effective April 4, 2022. To ensure an effective and smooth transition, Mr. Johnson continued to provide executive transition services through the end of fiscal 2022, and his base salary and annual bonus opportunity were reduced by 50% effective June 1, 2022, in proportion to the level of services he was expected to provide. Because Mr. Johnson was retirement eligible, his PRSUs and RSUs continued to vest under the terms of his existing award agreements. As discussed above, Mr. Johnson did not earn a cash incentive award, and he received the same payout of his fiscal 2019 PRSUs as other employees. In addition, Mr. Johnson's long-term cash performance-based award, which he was granted in December 2019, did not pay out as described above.\n\n## Separation of John Culver\n\nEffective October 1, 2022, we eliminated the chief operating officer role and Mr. Culver remained employed with the Company in a senior advisor role through January 1, 2023. Due to there no longer being an equivalent role for Mr. Culver, his employment was involuntarily terminated on January 2, 2023. Mr. Culver has executed a Separation Agreement and Release, which provided for the severance benefits set forth in our Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan in consideration for a release of claims in favor of Starbucks, and compliance with restrictive covenants, which included, among other provisions, compliance with non-solicitation, non-competition, and non-disparagement requirements."}

In addition, pursuant to the Separation Agreement and Release, Ms. Gonzalez's unvested PRSU awards and time-based RSU awards were pro- rated based on her service from the vesting commencement date of each applicable award through the date of her termination, and assuming target performance in case of the PRSUs. These pro-rated awards were settled in cash for an amount equal to the number of shares subject to such awards multiplied by our average February 2022 stock price. The payments and benefits to Ms. Gonzalez under the Separation Agreement were subject to her executing and not revoking a reaffirmation of a release of claims and other commitments and obligations, which included reaffirming her duties and responsibilities of her Confidentiality, Non-Solicitation, Non-Competition and Inventions Agreement. Please see the section entitled \"Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control\" for more information\n\nFollowing the adoption of Starbucks Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan, all executive officer severance benefits are expected to be paid pursuant to the terms of this plan.\n\n## Perquisites and Other Executive Benefits\n\nOur executive compensation program includes limited executive perquisites and other benefits. The aggregate incremental cost of providing these perquisites and other benefits to our NEOs is detailed in the \"Fiscal 2022 All Other Compensation Table\" on page 65. We believe the perquisites and other executive benefits we provide are\n\nrepresentative of those offered by the companies that we compete with for executive talent, and therefore offering these benefits serves the objective of attracting and retaining top executive talent."}

The Company maintains aircraft to facilitate business travel. The Company has adopted a comprehensive Corporate Aircraft Use Policy, including guidelines for annual reporting to the Audit Committee to ensure transparency relative to aircraft usage and the business purpose served. In accordance with the Corporate Aircraft Use Policy, the executive officers may enter into an aircraft time-sharing agreement, which allows them to use corporate aircraft for personal travel under the terms outlined in such aircraft time-sharing agreement between them and the Company. Personal use of the aircraft by an executive officer pursuant to the time-sharing agreement requires them to reimburse the Company for the operating expenses of such flights that is chargeable pursuant to Federal Aviation Regulations. The Company's Corporate Aircraft Use Policy allows for personal guests of executive officers and board members to travel on business-related flights on our corporate aircraft under certain limited circumstances. The policy also allows for certain executive personal travel done in connection with flight that is otherwise for a business-purpose. Both types of use result in imputed income to the executive or director under Internal Revenue Service regulations and, for NEOs, \"other compensation\" equal to the aggregate incremental costs to the Company resulting from such personal travel, which is reported in the Summary Compensation Table.\n\n- Security. We believe that the personal safety and security of our senior executives is of the utmost importance to the Company and its shareholders. Pursuant to our executive security program, we may from time to time provide personal security services to certain executives. Security services include home security systems and monitoring and, in some cases, personal security services. These protections are provided due to the range of security issues encountered by senior executives of large, multinational corporations and particularly with respect to high-profile executives. Based on a security study, the Company made the decision to provide personal security services to Mr. Schultz due to security considerations arising from his role as our interim chief executive officer and his significant visibility as our founder. We view the security services provided to Mr. Schultz as an integral part of our risk management program and as necessary and appropriate business expenses, given his importance to Starbucks. However, because such services may be viewed as conveying a personal benefit to Mr. Schultz, we have reported the aggregate incremental costs of such services in the \"All Other Compensation\" column of the Summary Compensation Table.\n\n- The Company did not pay personal security costs for any other executive in fiscal 2022, except in connection with business-related travel."}

We offer a comprehensive benefits package to all eligible full- and part-time partners in the U.S. and locally competitive benefits packages in other countries. In addition to our equity incentive plans discussed above, we offer an employee stock purchase plan to partners in the U.S. and Canada that allows participants to purchase Starbucks stock at a 5% discount to the fair market value at the end of each offering period under the plan. We believe our Total Rewards practices motivate our executives to build long-term shareholder value and reward the partners who take care of our customers.\n\n- Broad-Based \"Bean Stock\" Program: A long-term incentive grant of time-based RSUs was made in November 2021 to approximately 223,000 eligible non-executive partners in 21 markets around the world, including part-time partners. We refer to this broad-based equity program as our \"Bean Stock\" program. Bean Stock participants include those partners who work in our stores and serve our customers directly. In fiscal 2022, Bean Stock participants realized approximately $132 million in pre-tax gains from previously granted Bean Stock awards.\n\n- Future Roast 401(k) Savings Plan: Available to all U.S. partners who are at least age 18 with 90 days of service. The Starbucks Match within the 401(k) is 100% of the first 5% of eligible compensation contributed each pay period. The match is immediately fully vested and is contributed to each participant's 401(k) account each pay period along with the participant's contributions. In fiscal 2022, Starbucks contributed more than $146 million in matching contributions.\n\n- Insurance Coverage for Partners: For more than 30 years, Starbucks has provided health insurance coverage for partners working 20 hours or more a week. Starbucks also provides life and disability insurance to eligible partners.\n\n- College Achievement Plan: The Starbucks College Achievement Plan was launched in fiscal 2014. It provides eligible partners in the U.S. with the opportunity to earn a first-time bachelor's degree online from Arizona State University with 100% upfront tuition coverage. Additionally, our military service member and Veteran partners can extend an additional Starbucks College Achievement Plan benefit to a qualifying family member of their choice. As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023, nearly 10,000 partners had graduated with degrees, and more than 23,000 partners were participating in the Starbucks College Achievement Plan.\n\n- Paid Sick Time, Vacation, Holiday, and Parental Leave: Starbucks is an industry leader in paid sick time and parental leave and has competitive policies for vacation and holiday pay.\n\n- Partner Assistance: Our CUP Fund gives financial assistance to Starbucks partners in times of special need due to illness, death in the family, natural disasters, or other extreme circumstances.\n\n- Partner Financial Well Being: My Starbucks Savings enables eligible partners to save directly from their paycheck for emergencies and other financial needs. Starbucks provides an incentive to eligible partners at key milestones in their savings journey. Starbucks Student Loan Management program provides a platform for eligible Starbucks partners to manage their student loans. Both programs were launched in September 2022.\n\nThe above benefits specifically apply in the U.S., but we generally strive to provide similar benefits in all countries while considering the social coverage programs available in each country.\n\nExecutives are eligible to participate in all benefit plans we offer to partners generally. This helps us attract and retain top executive talent."}

The guidelines provide that each executive officer must hold a multiple of their annual base salary in Starbucks stock and include the following holding requirements:\n\n<table><tr><th colspan=\"2\">Ownership Requirement\nPosition (Multiple of Base Salary)</th></tr><tr><td>ceo</td><td>6x</td></tr><tr><td>executive officers</td><td>3x</td></tr><tr><td>other evps</td><td>2x</td></tr></table>\n\nIn addition, as discussed in more detail below, in November 2022, the Committee adopted a share ownership guideline of $15 million in unpledged shares for Mr. Schultz for the duration of his service as interim chief executive officer.\n\nEach executive officer generally has five years to achieve the minimum ownership requirement. If an executive is not on track to meet the requirement by the end of the third year after becoming subject to the guidelines, they will be required to hold 50% of the net shares received upon the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs. This holding requirement increases to 100% if the executive has not met the minimum ownership guideline by year five.\n\nIn addition to shares held outright, unvested RSUs that are subject only to a time-vesting condition count towards the ownership threshold. As of the date of this proxy statement, all our NEOs exceed their current ownership requirement.\n\n## Risk Considerations\n\nWe believe that the design and objectives of our executive compensation program provide an appropriate balance of incentives for executives and avoid inappropriate risks. In this regard, our executive compensation program includes, among other things, the following design features:\n\n- Balanced mix of fixed versus variable compensation and cash-based versus equity- based compensation;\n\n- Variable compensation based on a variety of performance goals, including Company and, where appropriate, individual performance goals;\n\nBalanced mix of short-term and long-term incentives;\n\n- Stock ownership and holding requirements;\n\n- Anti-hedging and pledging policies that apply to all partners;\n\n- Payout caps on incentive plans;\n\n- Recoupment policy; and\n\n- Compensation Committee oversight of incentive and commission arrangements below the executive level.\n\nFor fiscal 2022, Pay Governance performed an annual risk assessment of our compensation objectives, philosophy. and forms of compensation and benefits for all partners, including executives, to determine whether the potential risks arising from such policies or practices are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. Based upon this review, management and the Compensation Committee concluded that our compensation practices and policies do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company, and Pay Governance supported this conclusion. A report summarizing the results of this assessment was reviewed and discussed with the Compensation Committee at its September 2022 meeting."}

The Nominating/Governance Committee has been advised by outside counsel on the board's fiduciary responsibilities for overseeing pledging, of the potential risks associated with Mr. Schultz's pledging of shares, and developments in pledging practices generally. With respect to the shares pledged by Mr. Schultz as of January 13, 2023, the Nominating/Governance Committee believes that Mr. Schultz's pledging arrangements do not pose a material risk to shareholders or to Starbucks, in part because:\n\n(i) The pledged shares secure personal term loans only used to fund outside personal business ventures.\n\n(ii) The purpose of the hedge was not to shift or hedge any economic risk in owning Starbucks common stock.\n\n(iii) Mr. Schultz is our founder and largest individual shareholder, retaining 21,694,538 shares of our common stock as of January 13, 2023.\n\n62\n\nFurther as noted above, in November 2022, the Committee adopted a share ownership guideline of $15 million in unpledged shares so that his share ownership in Starbucks is aligned with other shareholders and that his share ownership requirement is meaningful given his outstanding pledge of shares of Starbucks common stock."}

These amounts reflect the potential threshold, target, and maximum annual incentive bonus awards payable to our NEOs as annual incentive bonuses for fiscal 2022 under the Company's Annual Incentive Bonus Plan. Amounts shown are calculated as a percentage of fiscal 2022 year-end base salary. See the discussion and analysis regarding annual incentive bonuses in the CD&A section beginning on page 47 above for further information. Threshold bonus amounts assume achievement of the objective performance goals, tied to adjusted net revenue and adjusted operating income, at 25% of target and an individual performance factor payout of 0-200% of target. Target bonus amounts assume achievement of the objective performance goals, tied to adjusted net revenue and adjusted operating income, at the target amount and an individual performance factor payout of 0-200% of target. Maximum bonus amounts assume achievement of the objective goals at the maximum for a payout of 200% of target and an individual performance factor payout of 200% of target. As discussed in the CD&A, each of our NEOs who was eligible to earn an annual cash incentive award for fiscal 2022 would have earned an award based on our financial results and profit positive and planet positive goals. However, after considering the recommendations of our interim chief executive officer, the Committee exercised its discretion to adjust all payouts under the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan to $0 for fiscal 2022, given our overall financial performance in fiscal 2022 and where we are currently in our Reinvention Plan (except with respect to Ms. Gonzalez, who received a payout, pursuant to the terms of her separation agreement as shown in the All Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table).\n\n# OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS AT FISCAL 2022 YEAR-END TABLE\n\nThe following table provides information regarding stock options, PRSUs, and RSUs held by our NEOs as of October 2, 2022.

The ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC requirements. The SEC's rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable because companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates, and assumptions in calculating their own ratios.\n\nStarbucks employs over 385,000 partners in over 17,500 company-operated stores, which impacts the comparability of our CEO pay ratio to the disclosed pay ratios of companies that operate solely under franchised- or licensed-store models. Partners frequently work in flexible, part-time roles, which has the effect of lowering the annual total compensation for our median employee. In addition, Starbucks is a global company, with approximately 140,000 partners outside the U.S. Therefore, the median compensation disclosed below is based on our global workforce and is not designed to capture the median compensation of our U.S. partners."}

This allows total compensation of the median partner to represent the median of all partners based on elements of compensation shared generally among our partners worldwide.

For permanent partners hired during the twelve-month period, compensation was annualized to reflect a full year of wages.
