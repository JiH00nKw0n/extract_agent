The growth of company-operated stores revenue was driven by a 10% increase in comparable store sales ($632 million), attributable to a 5% increase in comparable transactions and a 4% increase in average ticket. Also contributing was incremental revenues from 1,265 net new Starbucks® company-operated stores, or a 7% increase, over the past 12 months ($336 million). Partially offsetting these increases was unfavorable foreign currency translation ($96 million).\n\nLicensed stores revenue increased $179 million contributing to the increase in total net revenues, driven by higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($185 million).\n\nOther revenues decreased $42 million, primarily due to a decline in revenue in the Global Coffee Alliance ($31 million) and the absence of revenues from the Evolution Fresh business following its sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 ($18 million).\n\n28"}
