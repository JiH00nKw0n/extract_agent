This transaction did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nNote 3: Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nInterest Rates\n\nFrom time to time, we enter into designated cash flow hedges to manage the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates. We enter into interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks, which are synthetic forward sales of U.S. Treasury securities settled in cash based upon the difference between an agreed-upon treasury rate and the prevailing treasury rate at settlement. These agreements are cash settled at the time of the pricing of the related debt. Each derivative agreement's gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and is subsequently reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related debt.\n\nTo hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as fair value hedges. The changes in fair values of these derivative instruments and the offsetting changes in fair values of the underlying hedged debt due to changes in the relevant benchmark interest rates are recorded in interest expense. Refer to Note 8, Debt, for additional information on our long-term debt.\n\nForeign Currency\n\nTo reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, and intercompany borrowing and lending activities. The resulting gains and losses from these derivatives are recorded in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue, product and distribution costs, or interest income and other, net, respectively, when the hedged exposures affect net earnings.\n\nFrom time to time, we may enter into financial instruments, including, but not limited to, forward and swap contracts or foreign currency-denominated debt, to hedge the currency exposure of our net investments in certain international operations. The resulting gains and losses from these derivatives are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated.\n\nForeign currency forward and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments are used to mitigate the foreign exchange risk of certain other balance sheet items. Gains and losses from these derivatives are largely offset by the financial impact of translating foreign currency-denominated payables and receivables, and these gains and losses are recorded in interest income and other, net.\n\nCommodities\n\nDepending on market conditions, we may enter into coffee forward contracts, futures contracts and collars to hedge anticipated cash flows under our price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts, which are described further in Note 5, Inventories, or our longer-dated forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed price and price-to-be-fixed contracts are not yet available. The resulting gains and losses are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to product and distribution costs when the hedged exposure affects net earnings.\n\nDepending on market conditions, we may also enter into dairy forward contracts and futures contracts to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows under our dairy purchase contracts and our forecasted dairy demand. The resulting gains or losses are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to product and distribution costs when the hedged exposure affects net earnings.\n\nCash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge. Cash flows from hedging transactions are classified in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. For de-designated cash flow hedges in which the underlying transactions are no longer probable of occurring, the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. These derivatives may be accounted for prospectively as non-designated derivatives until maturity, re-designated to new hedging relationships or terminated early. We continue to believe transactions related to our other designated cash flow hedges are probable to occur.\n\nTo mitigate the price uncertainty of a portion of our future purchases, including diesel fuel and other commodities, we enter into swap contracts, futures and collars that are not designated as hedging instruments. The resulting gains and losses are recorded in interest income and other, net to help offset price fluctuations on our beverage, food, packaging and transportation costs, which are included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n11"}

The 2021 credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $1.0 billion.\n\nBorrowings under the 2021 credit facility, which was most recently amended in April 2023, will bear interest at a variable rate based on Term SOFR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company’s long-term credit ratings assigned by the Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating agencies. The “Base Rate” is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility) plus 0.500%, (ii) Bank of America’s prime rate, and (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.000%. Term SOFR means the forward-looking SOFR term rate administrated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange plus a SOFR Adjustment of 0.100%.\n\nThe 2021 credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of July 2, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our 2021 credit facility as of July 2, 2023 or October 2, 2022.\n\nShort-term Debt\n\nUnder our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under our 2021 credit facility. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of July 2, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under the program. As of October 2, 2022, we had $175.0 million in borrowings outstanding under this program.\n\nAdditionally, we hold the following Japanese yen-denominated credit facilities that are available for working capital needs and capital expenditures within our Japanese market:\n\n•A ¥5 billion, or $34.5 million, credit facility is currently set to mature on January 4, 2024. Borrowings under this credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (\"TIBOR\") plus an applicable margin of 0.400%.\n\n•A ¥10 billion, or $69.1 million, credit facility is currently set to mature on March 27, 2024. Borrowings under this credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on TIBOR plus an applicable margin of 0.300%.\n\nAs of July 2, 2023, we had ¥5 billion, or $34.5 million, of borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities.

As of July 2, 2023, Starbucks had more than 37,200 company-operated and licensed stores, an increase of 7% from the prior year. Additionally, we sell a variety of consumer-packaged goods, primarily through the Global Coffee Alliance established with Nestlé and other partnerships and joint ventures.\n\nWe have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada, 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other.\n\nWe believe our financial results and long-term growth model will continue to be driven by new store openings, comparable store sales growth and operating margin management, underpinned by disciplined capital allocation. We believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. Throughout this MD&A, we commonly discuss the following key operating metrics:\n\n•New store openings and store count\n\n•Comparable store sales growth\n\n•Operating margin\n\nComparable store sales growth represents the percentage change in sales in one period from the same prior year period for company-operated stores open for 13 months or longer and exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. We analyze comparable store sales growth on a constant currency basis as this helps identify underlying business trends, without distortion from the effects of currency movements. Stores that are temporarily closed or operating at reduced hours due to the COVID-19 pandemic remain in comparable store sales while stores identified for permanent closure have been removed.\n\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. Fiscal 2023 and 2022 include 52 weeks. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of store closures, unless otherwise noted.\n\nStarbucks results for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 demonstrate the overall strength of our brand. Consolidated net revenues increased 12% to $9.2 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $8.2 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily driven by strength in our U.S. business and international licensed markets as well as continued recovery from COVID-19 pandemic-related business interruptions in China. During the quarter ended July 2, 2023, our global comparable store sales grew 10%, primarily driven by 7% growth in the U.S. market and 24% growth internationally, demonstrating the strength of the Starbucks brand globally. Consolidated operating margin increased 140 basis points from the prior year to 17.3%, primarily driven by sales leverage, pricing and productivity improvement from increased efficiency in our U.S. stores. These were partially offset by previously-committed investments in labor, including enhancements in retail store partner wages and benefits as well as increased general and administrative costs related to our Reinvention Plan.\n\nResults of Operations (in millions)\n\nRevenues"}

We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (foreign and domestic) and commercial paper as well as principal-protected structured deposits. As of July 2, 2023, approximately $2.5 billion of cash and short-term investment were held in foreign subsidiaries.\n\nBorrowing Capacity\n\nRevolving Credit Facility\n\nOur $3.0 billion unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the “2021 credit facility”), of which $150.0 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on September 16, 2026. The 2021 credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $1.0 billion.\n\nBorrowings under the 2021 credit facility, which was most recently amended in April 2023, will bear interest at a variable rate based on Term SOFR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company’s long-term credit ratings assigned by the Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating agencies. The “Base Rate” is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility) plus 0.500%, (ii) Bank of America’s prime rate, and (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.000%. Term SOFR means the forward-looking SOFR term rate administrated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange plus a SOFR Adjustment of 0.100%.\n\nThe 2021 credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of July 2, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our 2021 credit facility as of July 2, 2023 or October 2, 2022.\n\nCommercial Paper\n\nUnder our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under the 2021 credit facility discussed above. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of July 2, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program. As of October 2, 2022, we had $175.0 million in borrowings outstanding under this\n\n36"}

As of July 2, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.\n\nUse of Cash\n\nWe expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial paper program and the issuance of debt to support and invest in our core businesses, including investing in new ways to serve our customers and supporting our store partners, repaying maturing debts, as well as returning cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and discretionary share repurchases and investing in new business opportunities related to our core and developing businesses. Furthermore, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy.\n\nWe believe that net future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for at least the next 12 months. We are currently not aware of any trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or that are reasonably likely to result in, our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way that will impact our capital needs during or beyond the next 12 months. We have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future. In this regard, we may incur additional debt, within targeted levels, as part of our plans to fund our capital programs, including cash returns to shareholders through future dividends and discretionary share repurchases as well as investing in new business opportunities. If necessary, we may pursue additional sources of financing, including both short-term and long-term borrowings and debt issuances.\n\nWe regularly review our cash positions and our determination of indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings. In the event we determine that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material. While we do not anticipate the need for repatriated funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity requirements, any foreign earnings which are not indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated at management’s discretion.\n\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2023, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $0.53 per share to be paid on August 25, 2023 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 11, 2023.\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we resumed our share repurchase program which was temporarily suspended in April 2022. During the three quarters ended July 2, 2023, we repurchased 6.9 million shares of common stock for $699.3 million. As of July 2, 2023, 45.7 million shares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations.\n\nOther than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for the remainder of fiscal 2023 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores, our supply chain and corporate facilities. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 are expected to be approximately $2.5 billion.\n\n37"}

The change was primarily due to a decrease in net cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities and higher net earnings during the period.\n\nCash used in investing activities totaled $1.4 billion for each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. Increased maturities and calls of investments in fiscal 2023 were offset by increased capital expenditures and higher investment purchases.\n\nCash used in financing activities for the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 totaled $2.1 billion compared to cash used in financing activities of $5.1 billion for the same period in fiscal 2022. The change is primarily due to a decrease in share repurchase activities.\n\nCommodity Prices, Availability and General Risk Conditions\n\nCommodity price risk represents our primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impact our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details, see Product Supply in Item 1 of the 10-K, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of the 10-K.\n\nSeasonality and Quarterly Results\n\nOur business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, of which our fiscal second quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income. Additionally, as our stored value cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season, we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year. However, since revenues from our stored value cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced. As a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
