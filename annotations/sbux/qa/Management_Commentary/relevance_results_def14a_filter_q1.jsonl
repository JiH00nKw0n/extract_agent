Together with our partners, we have co-created a Reinvention plan that touches every aspect of the Starbucks Experience. For our customers, we are using technology to make their visits to our stores personalized and effortless, while also freeing up store partners to focus on creating more moments of connection. We are meeting them where they are, whether that's a Cold Brew on the go from a Pick-Up store, a quiet moment with a cappuccino inside one of our cafés, or a deep-dive into coffee education with a workshop at our new Starbucks Reserve location at the Empire State Building. For our partners, we are equipping them with better tools and training and have committed more than $1 billion in partner and store experience investments We are bringing coffee excellence, coffee craft, and joy and a little bit of love back into being a Starbucks barista.\n\nOver the past year, we have seen that the demand the prior year to a record $32.3 billion, driven by phenomenal 8 percent global growth in comparable store sales. Starbucks International continues to drive growth for the company, and we expect two-thirds of global retail growth over the next three years to come from our international business As we continue to navigate the COVID pandemic and its impacts in China, we are focused on supporting our partners and leaders in the market and look forward to a bright future ahead.\n\nOur impact at Starbucks ripples on a global scale. We take this responsibility seriously and strive to make a positive difference in the lives of the people we serve and the planet we share. We believe that every partner and every customer should have a sense of belonging at Starbucks, and should be able to be their authentic selves every day. We are dedicated to advancing racial and social equity, and we are committed to furthering that work with intention, transparency, and accountability. We are striving to be a resource-positive company, to give back more of the planet's resources than we consume. To help us get there, we have clear and ambitious sustainability targets to reduce our carbon, water, and waste footprints in half by 2030. Additionally, we are integrating sustainability throughout our Reinvention efforts, working to ensure we are considering the impacts to sustainability with each one of our strategies.\n\n## Onward\n\nThe new fiscal year also marks a new chapter with incoming ceo, Laxman Narasimhan. Since joining the company in October, he has been traveling around the world and immersing in our company and culture. Each day we have together, including time in Origin with our extended leadership team this Fall in Hacienda Alcasia, Costa Rica, we are reminded he is an extraordinary global citizen and servant leader who is embracing the vision of Starbucks in his own way.\n\nWe are both so proud of the company Starbucks is today and will be tomorrow, and profoundly grateful to the more than 400,000 Starbucks partners who are a part of this great odyssey. We would also like to extend our appreciation to the Starbucks Board of Directors for their leadership and support during this time of reinvention and renewal. We are laying the foundation for the future of a Starbucks even more true to our shared mission: To inspire and nurture the human spirit - one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.\n\nWith respect and gratitude,\n\n(hssignature21-\n04a.gif\n\nHoward Schultz\nchief executive officer\n\nMellody Hobson\nindependent chair of the board\n\n*Growth rate is based on a 52-week basis.

Johnson as president and chief executive officer, and the appointment of Starbucks founder, Howard Schultz, as interim chief executive officer in April 2022. Our board of directors selected Mr. Schultz based on his role in building Starbucks into one of the world's most recognized and respected businesses, a company focused on delivering best-in-class financial performance, through exceeding the expectations of our people and our customers Under his leadership, Starbucks grew from 11 stores with 100 partners to more than 28,000 stores in 77 countries, and he pioneered programs like comprehensive healthcare, stock ownership, and free college tuition for full and part-time partners.\n\nAdditional leadership and organizational changes followed in fiscal 2022, which concluded with the appointment of Laxman Narasimhan, as chief executive officer-elect in October 2022. Mr. Narasimhan is expected to be appointed as our permanent chief executive officer in April 2023. Mr. Narasimhan brings nearly 30 years of experience leading and advising global consumer- facing brands. Known for his considerable operational expertise, he has a proven track record in developing purpose-led brands, and building on companies histories, he has succeeded in rallying talent to deliver on future ambitions by driving consumer-centric and digital innovations.\n\nGuided by Mr. Schultz and our partners, in fiscal 2022, we began to implement our Reinvention Plan, an inspired roadmap to build the future of Starbucks, while staying true to our mission of uplifting communities through a shared love for coffee and further extending our coffee leadership and innovation. Starbucks partners are at the core of the Reinvention Plan, and we are committed to investing in our partner base through recruiting, training, and onboarding initiatives. As part of the Reinvention Plan, we also are continuing to unlock the intersection of convenience and connection by introducing enhancements to the customer experience across the retail and digital realms. Finally, we are seeking to continue to accelerate our leadership position in international markets through the strength of our licensing model, the digital Starbucks Experience and purpose-driven growth in China.\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we continued to manage the business through global economic uncertainties, inflationary pressures, a resurgence of COVID-19 in China, and lower government subsidies. In fiscal 2022, we grew global revenues 13%* year-over-year to a record $32.3 billion, driven by 8% comparable stores sales growth globally and 12% comparable stores sales growth in North America as we saw meaningful growth in our global customer base. In the U.S., we grew our unique customers 9% year-over-year, and we saw a 16%* increase in U.S. Starbucks Rewards membership year-over-year to nearly 29 million members. However, international comparable store sales decreased 9%, primarily attributable to COVID-19 related restrictions in China, and our operating income and operating margin for the International segment decreased, driven primarily by lower sales related to COVID-19 restrictions in China, investments in our partners, and lower government subsidies."}

Each of our NEOs who was eligible to earn an annual cash incentive award under the annual Executive Management Bonus Plan (\"Annual Incentive Bonus Plan\") would have earned an award based on our financial and operational results, progress against our ESG initiatives, and their individual performance. However, given our overall financial and operational performance in fiscal 2022 and given that transformation efforts under our Reinvention Plan remain ongoing, our Compensation Committee elected not to pay any such awards for fiscal 2022. Our fiscal 2020 PRSUs (awarded in November 2019) paid out at only 61.25% due to our inability to achieve the rigorous earnings targets and our total shareholder return performance compared to the S&P 500 during the last three fiscal years. Further, Mr. Johnson's long-term cash performance-based award that was originally granted in December 2019 did not pay out given the challenging relative total shareholder return targets that were set for such award were not achieved"}

For fiscal 2022, the types of goals and the weightings of such goals were unchanged from fiscal 2021. However, the Compensation Committee elected to refine the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan for fiscal 2022 by clarifying that the Individual Performance Factor (\"IPF\") portion of our Annual Incentive Bonus Plan for fiscal 2022 would be weighted at 30% in the aggregate. The IPF portion was limited to Mission and Values and strategic and operational goals specific to each individual participant (20% overall weighting), and inclusion and diversity goals whose achievement will vary by participant (10% overall weighting), while our planet- and profit-positive goals for fiscal 2022 were separate and distinct factors, with each having a 10% weighting and more formulaic payout metrics. Our planet-positive and profit-positive goals were applied consistently across the executive officer team.\n\nThe Annual Incentive Bonus Plan and the results of our fiscal 2022 performance are described in detail starting on page 47. While each of our NEOs who was eligible to earn an annual cash incentive award would have earned an award based on certain financial results and their individual performance, our Compensation Committee made a determination not to pay any such awards for fiscal 2022, given our overall earnings performance in fiscal 2022 and given that transformation efforts under our Reinvention Plan remain ongoing.\n\n## Leadership Stock Plan\n\nGiven the positive feedback received from shareholders in respect of our fiscal 2021 executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee did not make any changes to the Leadership Stock Plan for fiscal 2022. For fiscal 2022, long-term incentives were awarded in the form of: (1) PRSUs, where the number of shares earned is based on three-year EPS performance against pre-established annual targets, subject to a downward or upward adjustment of 25% based on relative TSR performance and an additional downward or upward adjustment of up to 10% based on achievement of inclusion and diversity goals and (2) time-based RSUs.

Target total direct compensation is designed to be competitive with peer companies and market data, as explained below under Peer Group Companies and Benchmarking\n\nThe Compensation Committee typically reviews target total direct compensation and approves the target value of annual cash incentive awards (as a percentage of base salary) annually at its November meeting following the conclusion of the fiscal year. Base salaries, annual cash incentive payments (for performance in the prior fiscal year), performance goals for annual cash incentive awards, and long-term equity grants are approved after the end of each fiscal year at the Committee's November meeting. This process allows the Compensation Committee to consider comprehensive information, including the performance of each NEO during the prior fiscal year, when making final compensation decisions.\n\n## Management's Role in the Executive\nCompensation Process\n\nOur ceo, along with key members of our human resources function (\"Partner Resources\") and our Law & Corporate Affairs Department each help support the Compensation Committee's executive compensation process and regularly attend portions of the Committee's meetings. As part of the executive compensation process, our ceo provides his perspective to the Compensation Committee regarding the performance of his executive leadership team, which includes all our executive officers and certain other senior officers of the Company. Members of the Partner Resources team present recommendations to the Compensation Committee on the full range of annual executive compensation decisions, including (i) annual and long-term incentive compensation plans, (ii) target competitive positioning of executive compensation, and (iii) target total direct compensation for each executive officer. These recommendations are developed in consultation with our ceo (except with regard to his own compensation) and are supported by market data.\n\n## The Role of Consultants in the Executive Compensation\nProcess\n\nBeginning in September 2021, the Compensation Committee engaged Pay Governance as its outside independent compensation consultant The Compensation Committee's consultant regularly attends committee meetings and attends executive sessions as requested by the Compensation Committee's chair. During fiscal 2022, Pay Governance did not perform any services for Starbucks other than advising on executive compensation and non-employee director compensation under its engagement by the Compensation Committee. Pay Governance's tasks also included reviewing, validating, and providing input on information, programs, and recommendations made by management.\n\n## At-Risk Compensation\n\nA core principle of our executive compensation program is that a large majority of compensation awarded to our NEOs, especially to our ceo, be variable, performance-based or \"at-risk.\" This type of compensation is primarily dependent on the financial success of our Company and the performance of Starbucks common stock. This means that our executives are rewarded when they produce value for our shareholders and our partners. Elements of our fiscal 2022 program that fall within this category include annual cash incentive awards, PRSUs, and RSUs.\n\n## Internal Pay Equity\n\nThe Compensation Committee considers internal pay equity, among other factors, when making compensation decisions. However, the Compensation Committee does not use a fixed ratio or formula when comparing compensation among executive officers. The Compensation Committee believes that a failure to maintain an appropriate balance in the pay levels among members of our executive leadership team creates inappropriate business risks."}

The ESG performance goals will comprise Inclusion & Diversity goals as well as sustainability goals, which will continue to be objective and quantitative to ensure clear, rigorous goal-setting with respect to our ESG strategies and objectives. The Committee also updated our Inclusion & Diversity metrics for fiscal 2023 to both remove complexity and provide more relevancy to our Inclusion & Diversity goals, providing a clearer and more impactful path for participants to drive our progress in our people-positive efforts. Further, the profit-positive goals that applied for fiscal 2022, which included operating margin, comparable store sales, and net new stores, were eliminated for fiscal 2023 as the Compensation Committee determined that the outcome of such metrics was largely reflected in the adjusted net revenue and adjusted operating income metrics and ultimately duplicative of the financial performance metrics under the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan.\n\nThe IPF component of the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan for fiscal 2023 will represent 15% of the overall Annual Incentive Bonus Plan payout (from 30% for fiscal 2022).

Because Mr. Johnson was retirement eligible, his PRSUs and RSUs continued to vest under the terms of his existing award agreements. As discussed above, Mr. Johnson did not earn a cash incentive award, and he received the same payout of his fiscal 2019 PRSUs as other employees. In addition, Mr. Johnson's long-term cash performance-based award, which he was granted in December 2019, did not pay out as described above.\n\n## Separation of John Culver\n\nEffective October 1, 2022, we eliminated the chief operating officer role and Mr. Culver remained employed with the Company in a senior advisor role through January 1, 2023. Due to there no longer being an equivalent role for Mr. Culver, his employment was involuntarily terminated on January 2, 2023. Mr. Culver has executed a Separation Agreement and Release, which provided for the severance benefits set forth in our Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan in consideration for a release of claims in favor of Starbucks, and compliance with restrictive covenants, which included, among other provisions, compliance with non-solicitation, non-competition, and non-disparagement requirements."}

The Company has had annual votes starting with the 2012 annual meeting, following the advisory vote of shareholders in favor of annual \"say on pay\" votes, which was reaffirmed at the Company's 2017 annual meeting.\n\nWhile the Company's executive compensation programs are designed to promote a long-term connection between pay and performance, the board recognizes that executive compensation disclosures are made annually. Holding an annual advisory vote on executive compensation provides the Company with more direct and immediate feedback on our compensation disclosures. We believe that an annual advisory vote on executive compensation is consistent with our practice of seeking input and engaging in dialogue with our shareholders on corporate governance matters (including the Company's practice of having all directors elected annually and annually providing shareholders the opportunity to ratify the Audit Committee's selection of independent auditors) and our executive compensation philosophy, policies and practices.\n\nAlthough the vote is non-binding, the board will consider the vote results in determining the frequency of future say-on-pay votes. The Company will announce its decision on the frequency of say-on-pay votes in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC no later than 150 days after the Annual Meeting. Notwithstanding the board's recommendation and the outcome of the shareholder vote, the board may in the future decide to conduct advisory votes on a more or less frequent basis and may vary its practice based on factors such as discussions with shareholders and the adoptions of material changes to compensation programs.\n\n## Board Recommendation\n\nThe board of directors recommends a vote to conduct future advisory votes on executive compensation EVERY YEAR.\n\n72\n\nPROPOSAL 4"}

We believe Starbucks can, and should, have a positive impact on the communities we serve and that our employees-our partners-are at the heart of the Starbucks experience. As a board, it is our responsibility to ensure that Starbucks business and affairs are managed to meet Starbucks stated goals and objectives and that long-term interests of shareholder are served. Part of that responsibility includes working with management and our partners to invest in our partners health, well-being, and success and to create a culture of belonging that is centered around putting our partners first and where everyone is welcome.\n\nWe are proud of our investments in our Starbucks partners:\n\n- We provide the highest-rated benefits in the country for full- and part-time hourly workers (including medical coverage and stock benefits).\n\n- We offer competitive pay - with a minimum of $15/hour and average pay across our company-owned U.S. stores that is nearing $17.50/hour.\n\nSince 1991, our Bean Stock program has provided our partners the opportunity to share in the financial success of the company through shares of our stock-it's the reason our employees\n\nare called partners.\n\n2023 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n81\n\n## SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS\n\n- We are broadening health insurance options, providing 100% upfront tuition coverage for college tuition through the Starbucks College Achievement Plan with Arizona State University, providing mental health services at no cost, and recently introduced a new suite of financial well-being benefits for our U.S. partners.\n\n- To make our partners' days run more smoothly, we're improving the way our 'behind the bar' space is organized so it's easier to navigate during busy times, creating easy processes for partners to sign up for and trade shifts to fit their schedules, and working to improve staffing at busy stores.\n\nStarbucks partners' voices and concerns are top priority for both management and this board-we are listening. We continue to believe that, together with our partners, we can build a company defined by dignity and respect for each other and our planet. We are united in the shared purpose of uplifting the partner experience today and for years to come.\n\nOn November 17, 2020, Kevin Johnson, our then chief executive officer, issued our Global Human Rights Statement Our Global Human Rights Statement is an extension of our mission: to inspire and nurture the human spirit - one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time. In the Global Human Rights statement, we reiterated the following:\n\nWe respect the human rights of individuals and communities impacted by our operations and products, and we commit to respect the principles of the: UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights; UN Global Compact; OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises; International Bill of Rights; ILO Core Labor Standards; Women's Empowerment Principles; Children's Rights and Business Principles, and Framework Principles on Human Rights and the Environment"}
