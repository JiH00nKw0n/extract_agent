Our commitment to transparency, intentionality, and accountability underpins all our efforts to share extensive data on our progress against our ambitious ESG goals, business practices, work in sustainability, and our commitment to the communities we serve. As part of that commitment, since 2001, Starbucks has proactively published the Global Environmental & Social Impact report, an annual fiscal year update on key ESG programs and progress.\n\nWe promote ethical leadership and business practices to deliver our very best in all we do, while holding ourselves accountable for results. Our board and its committees are responsible for overseeing the effectiveness of our global environmental and social impact strategy. We govern our sustainability commitments through the Global Environmental Council, which is comprised of senior leaders across Starbucks whose compensation is tied to performance against our goals. We continue to implement an executive compensation program that includes benchmarks for achieving sustainability goals and building inclusive and diverse teams. All Starbucks partners are governed by internal policies addressing ethics and human rights issues, including Anti- Harassment, Anti-Discrimination, Conflicts of Interest, Gifts & Entertainment, Anti-Bribery, and Equal Employment Opportunity. And, we practice rigorous data collection, including third-party data verification, to ensure our reporting is accurate and representative of the great strides we are making to support our partners, customers, communities, and planet.\n\nStarbucks is also committed to being a force for global good by advancing equity and civic engagement so our partners can share their vision for stronger communities In the U.S., we provide tools and resources for partners to ensure their voice is heard in each and every election. Globally, we work with partners, licensees, and business partners to advocate for policies that support our partners, the health of our business and the communities we serve through the lens of our Mission and Values.\n\nStarbucks is building on over 50 years of great business through the lens of humanity to a future of exceptional service-service to our partners, service to our customers, and service to our planet. We believe this focus will support the success of our business and drive value for our shareholders as we continue to pursue our strategic priorities.\n\n- 1 Additional programmatic updates and performance against these priorities and publicly stated goals will be shared in Starbucks forthcoming FY22 Global Environmental and Social Impact Report.\n\n2\n\n- Starbucks.

This process is enterprise-wide for managers up to and including our ceo.\n\nOur board's involvement in our annual succession planning process is outlined in our Governance Principles. The Governance Principles provide that our Compensation Committee has general oversight responsibility for management development and succession planning practices and strategy. Our Compensation Committee, pursuant to its charter, annually reviews and discusses with the independent directors of the board the performance of certain senior officers of the Company and the succession plans for each such officer's position including\n\n28\n\nrecommendations and evaluations of potential successors to fill these positions. The Compensation Committee also conducts a periodic review of, and provides approval for, our management development and succession planning practices and strategies, including the review and oversight of risks and exposures associated with the succession planning practices and strategies.\n\n## ceo Succession Planning\n\nAs discussed in the board's recommendation on Proposal 6 Regarding ceo Succession Planning Policy Amendment, which is set forth on page 77, the board recently amended the Governance Principles to expand on ceo succession planning. A primary responsibility of the board is planning for ceo succession The chair of our Nominating/Governance Committee, together with the chair of the board (or, if the chair of the board is not independent, the lead independent director), the chair of the Compensation Committee, and the ceo (collectively, the \"succession planning team\") will annually evaluate and update as appropriate the skills, experience, and attributes that the board believes are important to be an effective ceo in light of our business strategy. The succession planning team will also annually review with the board, our ceo succession planning process, including the identification, development, and progress of internal candidates and how candidates have been assessed. Chief executive officer succession planning should be an ongoing process, with the goal of providing sufficient lead time before an expected transition while also being prepared for and responsive to unexpected developments.\n\n## Oversight of ESG\n\nOur board is highly engaged in ESG matters given that our global social impact, sustainability goals, and human capital are intricately linked to our strategic direction. Our board considers these matters at least annually in connection with the strategic plan. In addition, except where explicitly delegated to other board committees or retained by the board, our Nominating/Governance Committee is tasked with the responsibility of overseeing the effectiveness of our environmental, social, and corporate governance strategies, policies, practices, goals, and programs, including review of our annual Global Environmental and Social Impact Report. Further, our Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of human capital development plans and succession planning practices to foster sufficient management depth at the Company to support its continued growth and the talent needed to execute long-term strategies, while our Audit Committee is tasked with overseeing the Company's risk management, including with respect to certain ESG topics.\n\n## Board\n\nOur board is responsible for ensuring ESG risks and opportunities are integrated into Starbucks long-term strategy.\n\n## Nominating/Governance Committee\n\nOversees, reviews, and assesses the effectiveness of Starbucks ESG strategies, policies, practices, goals, and programs; annually reviews Starbucks corporate political contributions and expenditures to ensure alignment with Starbucks policies and values.\n\n## Compensation Committee\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nOversees certain ESG risks, as\npart of overall risk management,\nand also reviews ESG\ndisclosures in SEC filings.\n\nOversees the development,\nimplementation, and effectiveness of\nStarbucks practices, policies, and\nstrategies relating to human capital\nmanagement as they relate to Starbucks\nworkforce generally."}

The award was designed to retain Mr. Johnson in his role as president and ceo by providing compelling upside reward opportunity beyond the Company's regular executive compensation program for achieving exceptional shareholder returns. The award had a target value of $25 million but a payout under the award could only be earned if our relative TSR performance meaningfully outperformed the S&P 500 during the period beginning October 1, 2019, to September 30, 2022. Specifically, the award would have paid out at 100% of target if the Company's TSR performance relative to the companies comprising the S&P 500 index was at the 65th percentile, zero if performance was at the 40th percentile, and 200% of target if performance was at the 80th percentile, with linear interpolation between these points.

Prior to adoption of the Severance and CIC Plan, we would from time-to-time offer severance benefit arrangements for terminated or separated executives as part of a negotiated termination of employment in exchange for a release of claims against the Company and other restrictive covenants. The Severance and CIC Plan was also adopted to provide uniformity and internal equity with respect to severance benefits among similarly situated executives and avoid protracted negotiations with departing executives.\n\nThe table below describes the material features of the Severance and CIC Plan and the Committee's rationale for the design of the Plan."}

According to the International Labour Organization, \"Freedom of association refers to the right of workers to create and join organizations of their choice freely and without fear of reprisal or interference\" and collective bargaining \"allows workers to negotiate their working conditions freely with their employers.\"\n\nIn the U.S., many workers allege that Starbucks has interfered with these rights, including retaliation, intimidation, firings, captive audience meetings, store closings, undue surveillance, and illegally excluding unionized employees from wage and benefit increases-generating negative media coverage. Workers at hundreds of stores have voted to unionize, and regional offices of the National Labor Relations Board, after finding merit to hundreds of allegations of labor rights violations, have issued at least 20 complaints against Starbucks.2\n\nIn August 2022, a U.S. judge ordered Starbucks to reinstate seven Memphis, Tennessee employees who were allegedly fired for supporting an organizing campaign. 3 Also in August, the labor board requested that Howard Schultz read a notice to all employees informing them that some had been unlawfully denied benefits and pay increases.4\n\nWe believe the apparent misalignment between Starbucks' public commitments and its reported conduct represents material reputational, legal, and operational risks and may impact its long- term value. As Starbucks' 2021 10-K states \"our responses to any organizing efforts could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and have adverse effects on our business, including on our financial results.\" Failing to respect workers' rights could harm Starbucks reputation with consumers and hurt its ability to attract and retain a high-performing workforce, a crucial element of its ability to provide quality products and service. Research shows that union membership may have a positive effect on retention, in some cases, reducing resignations by as much as 65%.5 Studies show companies spend approximately 20% of an employee's salary to replace them.6\n\nGreater transparency on these issues could help address concerns about associated risks, and enable investors to perform human rights due diligence and assess Starbucks' adherence to its human rights commitments.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\t- https:/www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/04/new-york-starbucks-closed-union-drive; https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/business/economy/starbucks-union-howard-schultz\nnlrb.html\n\n- https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/starbucks-alleges-labor-board-misconduct-union-elections-us-cafes-2022-08-15;https://www.law360.com/employment-\nauthority/starbucks-tracker;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/06/starbucks-accused-of-more-than-200-labor-violations-in-nlrb-complaint.html https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/labor-\nboard-files-complaint-against-starbucks-for-withholding-raises-from-unionized-stores;https://www.nirb.gov/about-nlrb/what-we-do/investig\n\n\t- 3 s://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/starbucks-ordered-reinstate-workers-fired-amid-union-campaign-2022-08-184\n\n\t- 4 https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/business/economy/starbucks-union-howard-schultz-nlrb.html\n\n5\n\n- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226530917_The_Impact_of_Union_Membership_on_Intent_to_Leave_Additional_Evidence_on_the_Voice_Face_of_Union\n\n- 6 https://www.americanprogress.org/article/there-are-significant-business-costs-to-replacing-employees/"}

We believe Starbucks can, and should, have a positive impact on the communities we serve and that our employees-our partners-are at the heart of the Starbucks experience. As a board, it is our responsibility to ensure that Starbucks business and affairs are managed to meet Starbucks stated goals and objectives and that long-term interests of shareholder are served. Part of that responsibility includes working with management and our partners to invest in our partners health, well-being, and success and to create a culture of belonging that is centered around putting our partners first and where everyone is welcome.\n\nWe are proud of our investments in our Starbucks partners:\n\n- We provide the highest-rated benefits in the country for full- and part-time hourly workers (including medical coverage and stock benefits).\n\n- We offer competitive pay - with a minimum of $15/hour and average pay across our company-owned U.S. stores that is nearing $17.50/hour.\n\nSince 1991, our Bean Stock program has provided our partners the opportunity to share in the financial success of the company through shares of our stock-it's the reason our employees\n\nare called partners.\n\n2023 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n81\n\n## SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS\n\n- We are broadening health insurance options, providing 100% upfront tuition coverage for college tuition through the Starbucks College Achievement Plan with Arizona State University, providing mental health services at no cost, and recently introduced a new suite of financial well-being benefits for our U.S. partners.\n\n- To make our partners' days run more smoothly, we're improving the way our 'behind the bar' space is organized so it's easier to navigate during busy times, creating easy processes for partners to sign up for and trade shifts to fit their schedules, and working to improve staffing at busy stores.\n\nStarbucks partners' voices and concerns are top priority for both management and this board-we are listening. We continue to believe that, together with our partners, we can build a company defined by dignity and respect for each other and our planet. We are united in the shared purpose of uplifting the partner experience today and for years to come.\n\nOn November 17, 2020, Kevin Johnson, our then chief executive officer, issued our Global Human Rights Statement Our Global Human Rights Statement is an extension of our mission: to inspire and nurture the human spirit - one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time. In the Global Human Rights statement, we reiterated the following:\n\nWe respect the human rights of individuals and communities impacted by our operations and products, and we commit to respect the principles of the: UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights; UN Global Compact; OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises; International Bill of Rights; ILO Core Labor Standards; Women's Empowerment Principles; Children's Rights and Business Principles, and Framework Principles on Human Rights and the Environment"}

For example, the NLRB pursued injunctive relief in Federal Court in Arizona that the court denied, concluding that the NLRB did not have a likelihood of success on the merits, in part, because the NLRB premised its filing on testimony that was later found to be untrue. Likewise, an NLRB administrative law judge recently issued a decision in which the complaint filed by the NLRB General Counsel against Starbucks was dismissed. One NLRB official has reported to the agency's Inspector General that the agency's handling of Starbucks representation elections has been done in a way that is biased in favor of supporters of the union. This is contrary to the law, which confers upon employees the right to form, join, or assist a labor organization, or to refrain from doing so. The NLRB Inspector General has publicly announced his investigation into these reports.\n\nMoreover, where partners have selected a labor organization as their exclusive representative, Starbucks has committed to comply with the law and the rights of its partners to engage in collective bargaining.\n\nWhile we do not believe or agree that the independent, third-party assessment advanced by the proponent is necessary or in the best interest of Starbucks, its shareholders, or its partners, we recognize that Starbucks commitment to respect human rights within the framework of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights comes with the corresponding expectation that the company undertake human rights due diligence. Starbucks has commenced efforts to conduct a human rights impact assessment as a process to identify, assess, and address the company's most salient human rights impacts across the value chain. In developing the scope for the Starbucks human rights impact assessment, the company expects to prioritize salient human rights for deeper level review. To that end, labor rights principles outlined in the 1998 Declaration, including the principles of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, will be included in that process. As part of Starbucks commitment to transparency with respect to our global social and environmental impacts, we expect to make available the results of Starbucks human rights impact assessment to shareholders, stakeholders, and other interested parties. Recognizing that care must be taken when reporting on matters that are in active litigation because of privilege concerns, and recognizing that the proponents' proposal acknowledges that reality,\n\n82\n\nStarbucks expects to give due consideration to inclusion of labor rights where practicable and where such reporting does not adversely impact the company's litigation position.\n\nThe board of directors recommends that our shareholders vote against this proposal.\n\n## Board Recommendation\n\nThe board of directors recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal.\n\n2023 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n83\n\n# PROPOSAL 9\n\n# SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING CREATION OF BOARD COMMITTEE ON CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY\n\nRESOLVED\n\nShareholders of Starbucks request that the Board of Directors create a board committee on corporate sustainability to oversee and review the impact of the company's policy positions and advocacy on matters relating to the company's ongoing growth and sustainability. The company shall issue a public report on the committee's findings by the end of 2023."}
