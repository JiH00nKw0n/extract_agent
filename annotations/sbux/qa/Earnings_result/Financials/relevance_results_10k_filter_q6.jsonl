Unallocated corporate expenses include corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments.\n\nCorporate and Other operating loss increased to $1.8 billion for fiscal 2023, or 20%, compared to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2022. This increase was primarily driven by incremental investments in technology ($131 million), increased support costs of strategic initiatives including the Reinvention Plan ($86 million) and higher performance-based compensation ($56 million).\n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nCash and Investment Overview\n\nOur cash and investments were $4.2 billion and $3.5 billion as of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, respectively. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, fund acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign) and commercial paper as well as principal-protected structured deposits. As of October 1, 2023, approximately $2.5 billion of cash and short-term investments were held in foreign subsidiaries.\n\nBorrowing Capacity\n\nCredit Facilities and Commercial Paper\n\nRevolving Credit Facility\n\nOur $3.0 billion unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the “2021 credit facility”), of which $150.0 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on September 16, 2026. The 2021 credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $1.0 billion.\n\nBorrowings under the 2021 credit facility, which was most recently amended in April 2023, will bear interest at a variable rate based on Term SOFR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company’s long-term credit ratings assigned by the Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating agencies. The “Base Rate” is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility) plus 0.500%, (ii) Bank of America’s prime rate, and (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.000%. Term SOFR means the forward-looking SOFR term rate administrated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange plus a SOFR Adjustment of 0.100%.\n\nThe 2021 credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of October 1, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our 2021 credit facility as of October 1, 2023 or October 2, 2022.\n\n35"}

The change was primarily due to a decrease in net cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities, including lower inventory purchases driven by reduced coffee commodity prices, and higher net earnings during the period.\n\nCash used in investing activities was $2.3 billion for fiscal 2023, compared to $2.1 billion for fiscal 2022. The change was primarily due to an increase in spend on capital expenditures and increased purchases of investments in fiscal 2023, partially offset by increased maturities and calls of investments in fiscal 2023.\n\nCash used in financing activities was $3.0 billion for fiscal 2023, compared to $5.6 billion for fiscal 2022. The change was primarily due to a decrease in share repurchase activities, partially offset by an increase in net payments of commercial paper.\n\nCOMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS\n\nCommodity price risk represents our primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impact our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K.\n\nFINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nMarket risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate\n\n37"}

This total included $53.1 million related to disposal and impairment of company-operated store assets and $89.5 million primarily associated with accelerated amortization of ROU lease assets and other lease costs due to store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms.

We maintain cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that exceed federally-insured limits. We have not experienced any losses related to these balances, and we believe credit risk to be minimal.\n\nOur cash management system provides for the funding of all major bank disbursement accounts on a daily basis as checks are presented for payment.

Unrealized losses are charged against net earnings when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary. We review several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary, such as the length and extent of the fair value decline, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and whether we have the intent to sell or will more likely than not be required to sell before the securities' anticipated recovery, which may be at maturity. Realized gains and losses are accounted for using the specific identification method. Purchases and sales are recorded on a trade date basis.\n\nStructured Deposits\n\nWe hold short-term, principal-protected structured deposits that provide returns in the form of both fixed and variable yields; such variable yields are indexed to foreign exchange rates, equity-linked instruments or interest rate indices. The Company has elected to account for these using the fair value option with gains and losses recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings. For fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, resulting gains and losses were immaterial to our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\nMarketable Equity Securities\n\nWe also have a marketable equity securities portfolio, which is comprised of marketable equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). Gains or losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings. Refer to Note 4, Fair Value Measurements, for further discussion of our MDCP liability.\n\nEquity Investments\n\nEquity investments are accounted for under the equity method if we are able to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Our share of the earnings or losses as reported by the investees is classified as income from equity investees on our consolidated statements of earnings. The investments are evaluated for impairment annually and when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\nWe account for equity investments for which we do not have significant influence and without readily determinable fair values at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments as permitted by the measurement alternative. Investments for which the measurement alternative has been elected are assessed for impairment quarterly, or if a triggering\n\n49"}
