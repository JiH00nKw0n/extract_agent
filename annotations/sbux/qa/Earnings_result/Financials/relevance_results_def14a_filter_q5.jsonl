Each of our NEOs who was eligible to earn an annual cash incentive award under the annual Executive Management Bonus Plan (\"Annual Incentive Bonus Plan\") would have earned an award based on our financial and operational results, progress against our ESG initiatives, and their individual performance. However, given our overall financial and operational performance in fiscal 2022 and given that transformation efforts under our Reinvention Plan remain ongoing, our Compensation Committee elected not to pay any such awards for fiscal 2022. Our fiscal 2020 PRSUs (awarded in November 2019) paid out at only 61.25% due to our inability to achieve the rigorous earnings targets and our total shareholder return performance compared to the S&P 500 during the last three fiscal years. Further, Mr. Johnson's long-term cash performance-based award that was originally granted in December 2019 did not pay out given the challenging relative total shareholder return targets that were set for such award were not achieved"}

In fiscal 2022, we granted each of our NEOs who was employed by the Company prior to the beginning of the year long-term performance-based compensation in the form of PRSUs and RSUs. In connection with Mr. Narasimhan's appointment as chief executive officer-elect, Mr. Narasimhan received replacement equity grants in the form of PRSUs and RSUs, which were granted in respect of certain outstanding equity awards that Mr. Narasimhan forfeited when he left his previous employer to join Starbucks, consistent with market practice. All equity awards shown in this table were granted under the 2005 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan. PRSUs awarded to our NEOs in fiscal 2022 will generally vest, subject to continued employment and achievement of performance metrics, 100% on the third anniversary of the date of grant (or on November 11, 2023 with respect to Mr. Narasimhan's PRSU award providing for participation in the FY2021-2023 PRSU cycle, and on November 10, 2024 with respect to Mr. Narasimhan's PRSU award providing for participation in the FY2022-2024 PRSU cycle). The final number of PRSUs earned also will be based on achievement of an EPS goal, a relative TSR modifier, and a representation modifier as further discussed in the Leadership Stock Plan section of the CD&A beginning on page 52. The circumstances pursuant to which the vesting of PRSUs and RSUs accelerate are described below in the section entitled Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control-Equity Treatment on page 69."}
