The policy became effective, with respect to equity awards, beginning with awards granted in fiscal 2010 and, with respect to annual cash incentive awards, beginning with awards earned for fiscal 2010. In addition, since November 2017, our program provides for forfeiture of unvested equity awards as well as clawbacks of vested amounts and awards in the event the Company determines an executive has engaged in material misconduct, including willful and intentional failure to perform responsibilities, material failure to comply with Company rules, policies, or procedures, and personal conduct that is detrimental to the Company.\n\nOn October 26, 2022, the SEC adopted long-awaited final rules implementing the incentive- based compensation recovery provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rules direct the stock exchanges to establish listing standards requiring listed companies to develop and implement a policy providing for the recovery of erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation received by current or former executive officers and to satisfy related disclosure obligations. We intend to timely amend and restate our clawback policy to reflect these new requirements.\n\n61\n\n## Equity Grant Timing Practices\n\nMost of our equity grants occur on pre-established dates pursuant to our equity grant guidelines, with annual grants generally occurring on the later of the second business day after the public release of fiscal year-end earnings, or, if later, the final day of the board of directors' November meeting. Annual awards for executives are granted pursuant to a formula based on a specified dollar amount, with the number of shares and exercise price for each option grant determined based on the closing market price of our stock on the grant date and the number of shares for each RSU and PRSU grant determined by dividing the dollar amount by the closing market price of our stock on the grant date. The Compensation Committee approves annual awards for partners at the executive vice president level and above. The Compensation Committee has delegated authority to the interim chief executive and evp, Partner Resources to make annual grants, within certain parameters, to partners at the senior vice president level and below, and to newly hired or newly promoted partners below the executive officer level. All other new hire and promotion grants at the executive vice president level and above are approved by the Compensation Committee."}
