These include a free subscription to Headspace, an online application that enables guided meditation, and 20 free mental health therapy or coaching sessions annually with Lyra.\n\nOutside of the U.S., we have provided other innovative benefits to help address market-specific needs, such as providing interest-free loans to our U.K. partners to help cover rental deposits, mental health services in Canada, and in China, an extra 14th Month Pay initiative, giving retail partners an additional month’s salary as a bonus on top of the 13th month pay that is customary in China, as well as a monthly housing subsidy for full-time Starbucks baristas and shift supervisors, and comprehensive health insurance coverage for parents of partners.\n\nRole-based Support\n\nTo help our partners succeed in their roles, we emphasize continuous training and development opportunities. These include, but are not limited to, safety and security protocols, updates on new products and service offerings and deployment of technologies. Training provided through our Pour Over sessions, which are a series of inspiring talks with thought leaders to help partners understand how to bring the Starbucks Experience to life, include a wide variety of topics such as achievable goal setting, giving and receiving constructive feedback, and effective engagement with customers and communities.

We have made a commitment to achieve gender pay equity in all company-operated markets. Further, we have formulated pay-equity principles which provide equal footing, transparency and accountability as best practices that help address known, systemic barriers to global pay equity.\n\nAs of October 1, 2023, Starbucks employed approximately 381,000 people worldwide.

Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan and many of our other markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks® Mobile App and through other U.S. and international retailers.

Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points (“Stars”) earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at all company-operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in North America. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets.

Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model.\n\nIn our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores.\n\n8"}

We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels such as licensed stores, grocery and foodservice. The grocery and foodservice business is primarily through our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé established in August 2018.\n\nIn this 10-K, Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as “Starbucks,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our.”\n\nSegment information is prepared on the same basis that our management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, certain changes were made to our management team, and our operating segment reporting structure was realigned as a result. We realigned our fully licensed Latin America and Caribbean markets from our Americas operating segment to our International operating segment. We renamed the Americas operating segment to the North America operating segment, since it is comprised of our company-operated and licensed stores in the U.S. and Canada. We also made certain other immaterial changes between our International operating segment and Corporate and Other. There was no impact on consolidated net revenues, total operating expenses, operating income or net earnings per share as a result of these changes.\n\nWe have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other.\n\nAdditional details on the nature of our business and our reportable operating segments are included in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\n\nCertain prior period information on the consolidated statements of cash flows have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n\nOur consolidated financial statements reflect the financial position and operating results of Starbucks, including wholly-owned subsidiaries and investees that we control. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nFiscal Year End\n\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. Fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 included 52, 52 and 53 weeks, respectively. The 53rd week in fiscal 2021 fell in the fourth fiscal quarter.\n\nEstimates and Assumptions\n\nPreparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Examples include, but are not limited to, estimates for inventory reserves, asset and goodwill impairments, assumptions underlying self-insurance reserves, income from unredeemed stored value cards, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, future asset retirement obligations, commitments and contingencies, and the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements. Actual results and outcomes may differ from these estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment.\n\nRestructuring\n\nIn fiscal 2022, we announced our plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience (the “Reinvention Plan”). We believe the company-operated market investments in partner wages and trainings have increased retention and productivity while the acceleration of purpose-built store concepts and innovations in technologies have provided additional convenience and connection with our customers. As a result of the restructuring efforts in connection with the Reinvention Plan, we recorded approximately $22 million and $46 million to restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statements of earnings during fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Future restructuring and impairment costs attributable to our Reinvention Plan are not expected to be material.\n\n48"}

During fiscal 2021, we recorded approximately $155.4 million to restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statements of earnings. This total included $53.1 million related to disposal and impairment of company-operated store assets and $89.5 million primarily associated with accelerated amortization of ROU lease assets and other lease costs due to store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms. As this restructuring plan was substantially completed in fiscal 2021, we did not recognize any material restructuring and impairment amounts related to this plan during the fiscal years ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022.\n\nAs of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, there were no material restructuring-related accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nWe consider all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase, as well as credit card receivables for sales to customers in our company-operated stores that generally settle within two to five business days, to be cash equivalents. We maintain cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that exceed federally-insured limits. We have not experienced any losses related to these balances, and we believe credit risk to be minimal.\n\nOur cash management system provides for the funding of all major bank disbursement accounts on a daily basis as checks are presented for payment. Under this system, outstanding checks are in excess of the cash balances at certain banks, which creates book overdrafts. Book overdrafts are presented as a current liability in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nInvestments\n\nAvailable-for-sale Debt Securities\n\nOur short-term and long-term investments include investment-grade debt securities, all of which are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities with remaining maturities of less than one year and those identified by management at the time of purchase to be used to fund operations within one year are classified as short-term. All other available-for-sale securities are classified as long-term. We evaluate our available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. Unrealized losses are charged against net earnings when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary. We review several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary, such as the length and extent of the fair value decline, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and whether we have the intent to sell or will more likely than not be required to sell before the securities' anticipated recovery, which may be at maturity. Realized gains and losses are accounted for using the specific identification method. Purchases and sales are recorded on a trade date basis.\n\nStructured Deposits\n\nWe hold short-term, principal-protected structured deposits that provide returns in the form of both fixed and variable yields; such variable yields are indexed to foreign exchange rates, equity-linked instruments or interest rate indices. The Company has elected to account for these using the fair value option with gains and losses recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings. For fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, resulting gains and losses were immaterial to our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\nMarketable Equity Securities\n\nWe also have a marketable equity securities portfolio, which is comprised of marketable equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). Gains or losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings. Refer to Note 4, Fair Value Measurements, for further discussion of our MDCP liability.\n\nEquity Investments\n\nEquity investments are accounted for under the equity method if we are able to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Our share of the earnings or losses as reported by the investees is classified as income from equity investees on our consolidated statements of earnings. The investments are evaluated for impairment annually and when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\nWe account for equity investments for which we do not have significant influence and without readily determinable fair values at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments as permitted by the measurement alternative. Investments for which the measurement alternative has been elected are assessed for impairment quarterly, or if a triggering\n\n49"}

For products sold via delivery platforms, contractual terms are evaluated for each service provider to determine gross versus net presentation and revenues are also recognized when control of products are transferred to the customers. Delivery service fees were immaterial in the periods presented. Company-operated store revenues are reported excluding sales, use or other transaction taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities.\n\nLicensed Store Revenues\n\nLicensed store revenues consist of product and equipment sales, royalties and other fees paid by licensees using the Starbucks brand. Sales of coffee, tea, food and related products are generally recognized upon shipment to licensees, depending on contract terms. Shipping charges billed to licensees are also recognized as revenue, and the related shipping costs are included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\nWe consider pre-opening services, including site evaluation and selection, store architectural/design and development and operational training, to be performance obligations that are separate from the license to operate under the Starbucks brand. These services provide distinct value to our licensees, including business and industry insight and knowledge that transfers value apart from the license. Revenues associated with pre-opening services are recognized upon completion of the related performance obligations, generally when a store is opened. Royalty revenues are recognized based upon a percentage of reported sales, and other continuing fees, such as marketing and service fees, are recognized as the performance obligations are met.\n\nStored Value Cards\n\nStored value cards can be activated through various channels, including at our company-operated and most licensed store locations, online at Starbucks.com or via mobile devices held by our customers and at certain other third-party websites and locations, such as grocery stores, although they cannot be reloaded at these third-party websites or locations. Amounts loaded onto stored value cards are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue upon redemption. Historically, the majority of stored value cards are redeemed within one year.\n\nIn many of our company-owned markets, including the U.S., our stored value cards do not have an expiration date nor do we charge service fees that cause a decrement to customer balances. Based on historical redemption rates, a portion of stored value cards is not expected to be redeemed and will be recognized as breakage over time in proportion to stored value card redemptions. The redemption rates are based on historical redemption patterns for each market, including the timing and business channel in which the card was activated or reloaded, and remittance to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, if applicable.\n\nBreakage is recognized as company-operated stores and licensed stores revenue within the consolidated statement of earnings. For the fiscal years ended October 1, 2023, October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, we recognized breakage revenue of $196.1 million, $196.0 million and $164.5 million in company-operated store revenues, respectively, and $18.9 million, $16.7 million and $16.6 million in licensed store revenues, respectively.\n\nLoyalty Program\n\nCustomers in the U.S., Canada and certain other countries who register their Starbucks Card are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program, which is primarily a spend-based loyalty program. They earn loyalty points (“Stars”) in a variety of ways, including with each purchase at participating Starbucks stores. Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at company-operated and certain participating licensed stores in the U.S. and Canada. After accumulating a certain number of Stars, the customer earns a reward that can be redeemed for free product that, regardless of where the related Stars were earned within that country, will be honored at company-operated stores and certain participating licensed store locations in that same country.\n\nWe defer revenue associated with the estimated selling price of Stars earned by Starbucks Rewards members towards free products as each Star is earned and a corresponding liability is established in deferred revenue. This deferral is based on the estimated value of the product for which the reward is expected to be redeemed, net of estimated unredeemed Stars.
