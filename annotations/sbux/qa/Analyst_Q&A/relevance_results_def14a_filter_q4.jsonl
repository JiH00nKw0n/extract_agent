The representation metric will operate as a modifier to the payout of the fiscal 2022 PRSU award.\n\nAnnual EPS performance targets are set each year and then averaged at the conclusion of the three-year performance period to determine baseline payouts from 0-200% and three-year relative TSR performance is measured against the S&P 500. The PRSUs granted in fiscal 2022 reflect this structure and represent 60% of target long-term award value for fiscal 2022.\n\nThe extent to which PRSUs are earned is based on our achievement of annual adjusted EPS, relative TSR goals measured over a three-year period following the grant date, and, with respect to fiscal 2022 PRSUs, achievement of inclusion and diversity goals. Annual EPS targets are measured and certified by the Compensation Committee each year. To reflect performance above or below target, adjusted EPS has a sliding scale that provides for payouts greater than the target number of PRSUs if performance results are greater than target (up to a maximum 200% of payout) or less than the target number if performance results are lower than target (down to a 25% payout for threshold performance below which\n\n52\n\nthe payout would be 0%). If the threshold EPS goal under the PRSUs is not met, then the awards will pay out at zero. Linear interpolation will be applied to performance that falls between EPS goals.\n\nTo the extent the performance targets are met, earned PRSUs generally vest 100% on the third anniversary of the grant date, with a possible adjustment upward or downward of 25% based on achievement of predetermined relative TSR goals and, with respect to fiscal 2022 PRSUs, a possible adjustment upward or downward of up to 10% based on achievement of predetermined inclusion and diversity goals.\n\nThe TSR metric will modify the fiscal 2022 PRSUs (as well our other outstanding PRSU grants) as follows: (i) upwards to a maximum of 125% if Starbucks TSR ranking is equal to or exceeds the 75th percentile, and (ii) downwards to a threshold of 75% if the Starbucks TSR ranking is equal to or below the 25th percentile, with linear interpolation to be applied if Starbucks TSR ranking is between the 25th and 75th percentile and above and below the 50th percentile.\n\n## RELATIVE TSR MODIFIER\n\n<table><tr><th>25th Percentile</th><th>50th Percentile</th><th>75th Percentile</th></tr><tr><td>75%</td><td>100%</td><td>125%</td></tr></table>\n\nThe representation metric will modify the fiscal 2022 PRSUs as follows: (i) upwards to a maximum of 110% if the inclusion and diversity goal of 5% representation growth is met or exceeded; (ii) reducing the number of PRSUs earned by 5% if the inclusion and diversity goal is not achieved but growth is positive and below 5%; and (iii) reducing the number of PRSUs earned by 10% if representation falls over the three-year performance period.\n\n## REPRESENTATION MODIFIER ¹\n\n<table><tr><th>&lt;0%</th><th>&gt;0% and &lt;5%</th><th>&gt;5%</th></tr><tr><td>90%</td><td>95%</td><td>110%</td></tr></table>\n\n(1) For improvement of representation of Black, Indigenous, and Latinx partners at the manager level and above.\n\nThe threshold, target, and maximum number of PRSUs that could have been earned by the NEOs are disclosed in the Fiscal 2022 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table on page 65.\n\n2023 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n53"}

In contrast, the nondairy milk market, including oat, coconut, soy, and almond milks, is projected to grow from over $25 billion in 2022 to over $61 billion by 2029. Three major factors are driving the demand for nondairy milk: taste, lactose intolerance, and environmental concerns\n\nResearch shows that 82% of people who consume plant-based milk do so because they prefer the taste.\n\nWhile many people prefer nondairy milk over cow's milk, other individuals can't tolerate cow's milk at all: 95% of Asian, 80 to 100% of Native American, 60 to 80% of Black, and 50 to 80% of Latinx populations suffer from lactose intolerance Nonwhites currently comprise nearly 40% of the U.S. population, and that segment is growing, which means that increasing numbers of Americans may hesitate to visit Starbucks or order drinks that include milk because of our current upcharge on nondairy milk.\n\nApproximately 56% of surveyed individuals who choose nondairy milk do so because of environmental concerns. Starbucks has publicly disclosed that dairy milk is the biggest contributor to our company's carbon footprint and the second-highest contributor to water usage. Cattle, including dairy COWS, account for roughly 40% of all greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture; plant-based milks produce less than one-third of CO2 emissions It takes 144 gallons of water to produce just 1 gallon of dairy milk; nondairy milks require up to 90% less water.\n\nStarbucks has committed to increasing plant-based options as a way of investing in an environmentally friendly menu. It is reasonable for shareholders to request an analysis of the potential costs to our company of the current upcharge on nondairy milk with regard to public relations and lost sales. Accordingly, we urge all shareholders to support this resolution."}

In April 2022, former CEO Kevin Johnson retired and Howard Schultz returned as Interim CEO while the Board searched for a permanent replacement. In explaining Starbucks' external search, Schultz told a reporter, \"For the future of the company, we need a domain of experience and expertise in a number of disciplines that we don't have now.\" While there may be circumstances where an external candidate is the best choice, not having any viable internal candidates is evidence of the Board's weak succession planning.\n\nReportedly, the Board was notified of Johnson's pending retirement at least one year in advance. Poor succession planning resulted in Starbucks losing a critical component of a smooth transition: business continuity. Rather than Johnson playing a large role in the onboarding of a successor, Laxman Narasimhan spent months shadowing Schultz who was retired for five years before his recent return. Adding to the bumpy transition, Schultz launched a \"Reinvention Plan\" that included changes to Starbucks strategy and leadership structure prior to Narasimhan's start.²\n\nAn effective succession planning process includes the regular evaluation of skills and competencies needed in a successor, identification of promising internal candidates, and a talent development strategy. A dynamic policy would better equip Starbucks for an emergency or planned succession with capable internal candidates and a candidate profile to expedite an external search. Developing a robust leadership pipeline has a myriad of benefits including retained institutional knowledge and increased employee morale and retention. The current policy is lacking, and we fear the Board is overly reliant on Schultz, as this was his second return.\n\nResearch suggests that poorly planned successions and external successors negatively impact financial performance. A 2006 study found that delays in hiring a successor and recruiting externally decreased subsequent financial performance. Research published in the Harvard Business Review in 2021 suggests that CEOs hired internally could perform better than external hires 61% of the time.4 A 2001 study found that hiring externally following a CEO retirement precipitated a nearly 6% drop in performance. Given these risks, Starbucks would benefit from a robust succession planning policy that produces viable internal candidates going forward.\n\n- 1 https://www.wsj.com/articles/howard-schultz-says-starbucks-is-seeking-fresh-blood-in-ceo-search-11654488060\n\n- 2 htps://www.restaurantdive.com/news/Starbucks-eliminates-COO-role/630060/;https:/investor.starbucks.com/press-releases/financial-releases/press-release-details/2022/Starbucks-Enters\new-Era-of-Growth-Driven-by-an-Unparalleled-Reinvention-Plan/default.aspx\n\n- 3 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287508898_Deaths_of_CEOs_Are_delays_in_naming_successors_and_insideroutsider_succession_associated_with_subsequent_firm_performan\n\n4 ps://hbr.org/2021/05/the-high-cost-of-poor-succession-planning\n\n- 5 https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/leadership-the-performance-impact-of-new-ceos/\n\n## BOARD RECOMMENDATION\n\nThe Starbucks board of directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons:\n\nOur Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our board of directors reviewed proponent's proposal and directed our general counsel and our corporate secretary to propose revisions to our Corporate Governance Principles and Practices for the Board of Directors (our \"Governance Principles\") that would consider suggestions made in the proposal.

According to the International Labour Organization, \"Freedom of association refers to the right of workers to create and join organizations of their choice freely and without fear of reprisal or interference\" and collective bargaining \"allows workers to negotiate their working conditions freely with their employers.\"\n\nIn the U.S., many workers allege that Starbucks has interfered with these rights, including retaliation, intimidation, firings, captive audience meetings, store closings, undue surveillance, and illegally excluding unionized employees from wage and benefit increases-generating negative media coverage. Workers at hundreds of stores have voted to unionize, and regional offices of the National Labor Relations Board, after finding merit to hundreds of allegations of labor rights violations, have issued at least 20 complaints against Starbucks.2\n\nIn August 2022, a U.S. judge ordered Starbucks to reinstate seven Memphis, Tennessee employees who were allegedly fired for supporting an organizing campaign. 3 Also in August, the labor board requested that Howard Schultz read a notice to all employees informing them that some had been unlawfully denied benefits and pay increases.4\n\nWe believe the apparent misalignment between Starbucks' public commitments and its reported conduct represents material reputational, legal, and operational risks and may impact its long- term value. As Starbucks' 2021 10-K states \"our responses to any organizing efforts could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and have adverse effects on our business, including on our financial results.\" Failing to respect workers' rights could harm Starbucks reputation with consumers and hurt its ability to attract and retain a high-performing workforce, a crucial element of its ability to provide quality products and service. Research shows that union membership may have a positive effect on retention, in some cases, reducing resignations by as much as 65%.5 Studies show companies spend approximately 20% of an employee's salary to replace them.6\n\nGreater transparency on these issues could help address concerns about associated risks, and enable investors to perform human rights due diligence and assess Starbucks' adherence to its human rights commitments.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\t- https:/www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/04/new-york-starbucks-closed-union-drive; https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/business/economy/starbucks-union-howard-schultz\nnlrb.html\n\n- https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/starbucks-alleges-labor-board-misconduct-union-elections-us-cafes-2022-08-15;https://www.law360.com/employment-\nauthority/starbucks-tracker;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/06/starbucks-accused-of-more-than-200-labor-violations-in-nlrb-complaint.html https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/labor-\nboard-files-complaint-against-starbucks-for-withholding-raises-from-unionized-stores;https://www.nirb.gov/about-nlrb/what-we-do/investig\n\n\t- 3 s://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/starbucks-ordered-reinstate-workers-fired-amid-union-campaign-2022-08-184\n\n\t- 4 https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/business/economy/starbucks-union-howard-schultz-nlrb.html\n\n5\n\n- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226530917_The_Impact_of_Union_Membership_on_Intent_to_Leave_Additional_Evidence_on_the_Voice_Face_of_Union\n\n- 6 https://www.americanprogress.org/article/there-are-significant-business-costs-to-replacing-employees/"}
