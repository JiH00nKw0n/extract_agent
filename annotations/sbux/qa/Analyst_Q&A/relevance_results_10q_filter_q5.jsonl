This transaction did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nNote 3: Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nInterest Rates\n\nFrom time to time, we enter into designated cash flow hedges to manage the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates. We enter into interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks, which are synthetic forward sales of U.S. Treasury securities settled in cash based upon the difference between an agreed-upon treasury rate and the prevailing treasury rate at settlement. These agreements are cash settled at the time of the pricing of the related debt. Each derivative agreement's gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and is subsequently reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related debt.\n\nTo hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as fair value hedges. The changes in fair values of these derivative instruments and the offsetting changes in fair values of the underlying hedged debt due to changes in the relevant benchmark interest rates are recorded in interest expense. Refer to Note 8, Debt, for additional information on our long-term debt.\n\nForeign Currency\n\nTo reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, and intercompany borrowing and lending activities. The resulting gains and losses from these derivatives are recorded in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue, product and distribution costs, or interest income and other, net, respectively, when the hedged exposures affect net earnings.\n\nFrom time to time, we may enter into financial instruments, including, but not limited to, forward and swap contracts or foreign currency-denominated debt, to hedge the currency exposure of our net investments in certain international operations. The resulting gains and losses from these derivatives are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated.\n\nForeign currency forward and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments are used to mitigate the foreign exchange risk of certain other balance sheet items. Gains and losses from these derivatives are largely offset by the financial impact of translating foreign currency-denominated payables and receivables, and these gains and losses are recorded in interest income and other, net.\n\nCommodities\n\nDepending on market conditions, we may enter into coffee forward contracts, futures contracts and collars to hedge anticipated cash flows under our price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts, which are described further in Note 5, Inventories, or our longer-dated forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed price and price-to-be-fixed contracts are not yet available. The resulting gains and losses are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to product and distribution costs when the hedged exposure affects net earnings.\n\nDepending on market conditions, we may also enter into dairy forward contracts and futures contracts to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows under our dairy purchase contracts and our forecasted dairy demand. The resulting gains or losses are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to product and distribution costs when the hedged exposure affects net earnings.\n\nCash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge. Cash flows from hedging transactions are classified in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. For de-designated cash flow hedges in which the underlying transactions are no longer probable of occurring, the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. These derivatives may be accounted for prospectively as non-designated derivatives until maturity, re-designated to new hedging relationships or terminated early. We continue to believe transactions related to our other designated cash flow hedges are probable to occur.\n\nTo mitigate the price uncertainty of a portion of our future purchases, including diesel fuel and other commodities, we enter into swap contracts, futures and collars that are not designated as hedging instruments. The resulting gains and losses are recorded in interest income and other, net to help offset price fluctuations on our beverage, food, packaging and transportation costs, which are included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n11"}

A portion of our price-to-be-fixed contracts are effectively fixed through the use of futures. See Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, for further discussion. Price-to-be-fixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore the price, at which the base “C” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. For most contracts, either Starbucks or the seller has the option to “fix” the base “C” coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date. For other contracts, Starbucks and the seller may agree upon pricing parameters determined by the base “C” coffee commodity price. Until prices are fixed, we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments. We believe, based on established relationships with our suppliers and continuous monitoring, the risk of non-delivery on these purchase commitments is remote.\n\nNote 6: Supplemental Balance Sheet and Statement of Earnings Information (in millions):\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, net"}

There have been no material changes to our material cash requirements during the period covered by this 10-Q outside of the normal course of our business.\n\nCash Flows\n\nCash provided by operating activities was $4.1 billion for the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, compared to $3.3 billion for the same period in fiscal 2022. The change was primarily due to a decrease in net cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities and higher net earnings during the period.\n\nCash used in investing activities totaled $1.4 billion for each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. Increased maturities and calls of investments in fiscal 2023 were offset by increased capital expenditures and higher investment purchases.\n\nCash used in financing activities for the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 totaled $2.1 billion compared to cash used in financing activities of $5.1 billion for the same period in fiscal 2022. The change is primarily due to a decrease in share repurchase activities.\n\nCommodity Prices, Availability and General Risk Conditions\n\nCommodity price risk represents our primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impact our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details, see Product Supply in Item 1 of the 10-K, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of the 10-K.\n\nSeasonality and Quarterly Results\n\nOur business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, of which our fiscal second quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income. Additionally, as our stored value cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season, we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year. However, since revenues from our stored value cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced. As a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since the 10-K.\n\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\nSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this 10-Q, for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements.\n\nItem 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nThere has been no material change in the commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk, equity security price risk or interest rate risk discussed in Item 7A of the 10-K.\n\n38"}
