Annual EPS targets are measured and certified by the Compensation Committee each year. To reflect performance above or below target, adjusted EPS has a sliding scale that provides for payouts greater than the target number of PRSUs if performance results are greater than target (up to a maximum 200% of payout) or less than the target number if performance results are lower than target (down to a 25% payout for threshold performance below which\n\n52\n\nthe payout would be 0%).

The Committee also updated our Inclusion & Diversity metrics for fiscal 2023 to both remove complexity and provide more relevancy to our Inclusion & Diversity goals, providing a clearer and more impactful path for participants to drive our progress in our people-positive efforts. Further, the profit-positive goals that applied for fiscal 2022, which included operating margin, comparable store sales, and net new stores, were eliminated for fiscal 2023 as the Compensation Committee determined that the outcome of such metrics was largely reflected in the adjusted net revenue and adjusted operating income metrics and ultimately duplicative of the financial performance metrics under the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan.\n\nThe IPF component of the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan for fiscal 2023 will represent 15% of the overall Annual Incentive Bonus Plan payout (from 30% for fiscal 2022).

Because Mr. Johnson was retirement eligible, his PRSUs and RSUs continued to vest under the terms of his existing award agreements. As discussed above, Mr. Johnson did not earn a cash incentive award, and he received the same payout of his fiscal 2019 PRSUs as other employees. In addition, Mr. Johnson's long-term cash performance-based award, which he was granted in December 2019, did not pay out as described above.\n\n## Separation of John Culver\n\nEffective October 1, 2022, we eliminated the chief operating officer role and Mr. Culver remained employed with the Company in a senior advisor role through January 1, 2023. Due to there no longer being an equivalent role for Mr. Culver, his employment was involuntarily terminated on January 2, 2023. Mr. Culver has executed a Separation Agreement and Release, which provided for the severance benefits set forth in our Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan in consideration for a release of claims in favor of Starbucks, and compliance with restrictive covenants, which included, among other provisions, compliance with non-solicitation, non-competition, and non-disparagement requirements."}
