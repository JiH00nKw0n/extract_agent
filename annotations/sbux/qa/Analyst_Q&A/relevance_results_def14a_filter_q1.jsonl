The board's oversight of risk is another integral component of the board's oversight and engagement on strategic matters. Strategy-related matters are regularly discussed at board meetings and, when relevant, at committee meetings. We also dedicate at least one board meeting every year to an even more intensive review and discussion of the Company's strategic plan. Matters of strategy also inform committee-level discussions of many issues, including business risk. Engagement of the board on these issues and other matters of strategic importance continues in between meetings, including through updates to the board on significant items and discussions by the ceo with the independent chair of the board on a periodic basis. Each director is expected to and does bring to bear their own talents, insights, and experiences to these strategy discussions.\n\n## BEYOND THE BOARDROOM\n\nIn order to increase each director's engagement with and understanding of our strategy, each director participates in an extensive orientation program upon joining the board, including meeting with members of our executive leadership team and other key leaders of the Company to gain a deeper understanding of Starbucks businesses and operations, attending cultural immersion programs, and visiting our stores to engage with store partners and customers first-hand.

This process is enterprise-wide for managers up to and including our ceo.\n\nOur board's involvement in our annual succession planning process is outlined in our Governance Principles. The Governance Principles provide that our Compensation Committee has general oversight responsibility for management development and succession planning practices and strategy. Our Compensation Committee, pursuant to its charter, annually reviews and discusses with the independent directors of the board the performance of certain senior officers of the Company and the succession plans for each such officer's position including\n\n28\n\nrecommendations and evaluations of potential successors to fill these positions. The Compensation Committee also conducts a periodic review of, and provides approval for, our management development and succession planning practices and strategies, including the review and oversight of risks and exposures associated with the succession planning practices and strategies.\n\n## ceo Succession Planning\n\nAs discussed in the board's recommendation on Proposal 6 Regarding ceo Succession Planning Policy Amendment, which is set forth on page 77, the board recently amended the Governance Principles to expand on ceo succession planning. A primary responsibility of the board is planning for ceo succession The chair of our Nominating/Governance Committee, together with the chair of the board (or, if the chair of the board is not independent, the lead independent director), the chair of the Compensation Committee, and the ceo (collectively, the \"succession planning team\") will annually evaluate and update as appropriate the skills, experience, and attributes that the board believes are important to be an effective ceo in light of our business strategy. The succession planning team will also annually review with the board, our ceo succession planning process, including the identification, development, and progress of internal candidates and how candidates have been assessed. Chief executive officer succession planning should be an ongoing process, with the goal of providing sufficient lead time before an expected transition while also being prepared for and responsive to unexpected developments.\n\n## Oversight of ESG\n\nOur board is highly engaged in ESG matters given that our global social impact, sustainability goals, and human capital are intricately linked to our strategic direction. Our board considers these matters at least annually in connection with the strategic plan. In addition, except where explicitly delegated to other board committees or retained by the board, our Nominating/Governance Committee is tasked with the responsibility of overseeing the effectiveness of our environmental, social, and corporate governance strategies, policies, practices, goals, and programs, including review of our annual Global Environmental and Social Impact Report. Further, our Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the development and implementation of human capital development plans and succession planning practices to foster sufficient management depth at the Company to support its continued growth and the talent needed to execute long-term strategies, while our Audit Committee is tasked with overseeing the Company's risk management, including with respect to certain ESG topics.\n\n## Board\n\nOur board is responsible for ensuring ESG risks and opportunities are integrated into Starbucks long-term strategy.\n\n## Nominating/Governance Committee\n\nOversees, reviews, and assesses the effectiveness of Starbucks ESG strategies, policies, practices, goals, and programs; annually reviews Starbucks corporate political contributions and expenditures to ensure alignment with Starbucks policies and values.\n\n## Compensation Committee\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nOversees certain ESG risks, as\npart of overall risk management,\nand also reviews ESG\ndisclosures in SEC filings.\n\nOversees the development,\nimplementation, and effectiveness of\nStarbucks practices, policies, and\nstrategies relating to human capital\nmanagement as they relate to Starbucks\nworkforce generally."}

Our chief information security officer is ultimately responsible for our cybersecurity program, which includes the implementation of controls aligned with industry guidelines and applicable statutes and regulations to identify threats, detect attacks, and protect these information assets. We have implemented security monitoring capabilities designed to alert us to suspicious activity and developed an incident response program that includes periodic testing and is designed to restore business operations as quickly and as orderly as possible in the event of a breach. In addition, partners participate in ongoing mandatory annual trainings and receive communications regarding the cybersecurity environment to increase awareness throughout the Company. Our Audit Committee, which oversees data privacy and cybersecurity risk matters, is comprised entirely of independent directors, one of whom has significant work experience related to information security issues and oversight. Management will report security instances to the Audit Committee as they occur, if material, and will also provide a summary multiple times per year to the Audit Committee Additionally, our chief information security officer meets at least twice annually with the board of directors or the Audit Committee to brief them on technology and information security matters. We carry insurance that provides protection against the potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident. In the last three years, the expenses we have incurred from information security breach incidences were immaterial. This includes penalties and settlements, of which there were none.\n\n## Shareholder Engagement\n\nWe have a year-round shareholder outreach program through which we solicit feedback on diverse business areas, ranging from our executive compensation program and corporate governance practices to disclosure practices and environmental and social impact programs and goals. We share feedback we receive with our board of directors, as well as other board committees such as the Compensation Committee and the Nominating/Governance Committee, as appropriate. Our board considers feedback received from shareholders throughout the year, and such input influences changes to our compensation program and the adoption of new governance practices. Every year, our outreach effort is conducted by a cross-functional team including: Investor Relations, Law & Corporate Affairs, Inclusion and Diversity, Public Affairs, Global Coffee, Sustainability and Social Impact, and Partner Resources Organization. Additionally, our ceo and cfo are engaged in meaningful dialogue with our shareholders through our quarterly earnings calls and investor-related outreach events. For more information about our shareholder engagement, see page 11.\n\n## ROLE OF OUR BOARD COMMITTEES\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, our board of directors had three standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating/Governance Committee.

The representation metric will operate as a modifier to the payout of the fiscal 2022 PRSU award.\n\nAnnual EPS performance targets are set each year and then averaged at the conclusion of the three-year performance period to determine baseline payouts from 0-200% and three-year relative TSR performance is measured against the S&P 500. The PRSUs granted in fiscal 2022 reflect this structure and represent 60% of target long-term award value for fiscal 2022.\n\nThe extent to which PRSUs are earned is based on our achievement of annual adjusted EPS, relative TSR goals measured over a three-year period following the grant date, and, with respect to fiscal 2022 PRSUs, achievement of inclusion and diversity goals. Annual EPS targets are measured and certified by the Compensation Committee each year. To reflect performance above or below target, adjusted EPS has a sliding scale that provides for payouts greater than the target number of PRSUs if performance results are greater than target (up to a maximum 200% of payout) or less than the target number if performance results are lower than target (down to a 25% payout for threshold performance below which\n\n52\n\nthe payout would be 0%). If the threshold EPS goal under the PRSUs is not met, then the awards will pay out at zero. Linear interpolation will be applied to performance that falls between EPS goals.\n\nTo the extent the performance targets are met, earned PRSUs generally vest 100% on the third anniversary of the grant date, with a possible adjustment upward or downward of 25% based on achievement of predetermined relative TSR goals and, with respect to fiscal 2022 PRSUs, a possible adjustment upward or downward of up to 10% based on achievement of predetermined inclusion and diversity goals.\n\nThe TSR metric will modify the fiscal 2022 PRSUs (as well our other outstanding PRSU grants) as follows: (i) upwards to a maximum of 125% if Starbucks TSR ranking is equal to or exceeds the 75th percentile, and (ii) downwards to a threshold of 75% if the Starbucks TSR ranking is equal to or below the 25th percentile, with linear interpolation to be applied if Starbucks TSR ranking is between the 25th and 75th percentile and above and below the 50th percentile.\n\n## RELATIVE TSR MODIFIER\n\n<table><tr><th>25th Percentile</th><th>50th Percentile</th><th>75th Percentile</th></tr><tr><td>75%</td><td>100%</td><td>125%</td></tr></table>\n\nThe representation metric will modify the fiscal 2022 PRSUs as follows: (i) upwards to a maximum of 110% if the inclusion and diversity goal of 5% representation growth is met or exceeded; (ii) reducing the number of PRSUs earned by 5% if the inclusion and diversity goal is not achieved but growth is positive and below 5%; and (iii) reducing the number of PRSUs earned by 10% if representation falls over the three-year performance period.\n\n## REPRESENTATION MODIFIER ¹\n\n<table><tr><th>&lt;0%</th><th>&gt;0% and &lt;5%</th><th>&gt;5%</th></tr><tr><td>90%</td><td>95%</td><td>110%</td></tr></table>\n\n(1) For improvement of representation of Black, Indigenous, and Latinx partners at the manager level and above.\n\nThe threshold, target, and maximum number of PRSUs that could have been earned by the NEOs are disclosed in the Fiscal 2022 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table on page 65.\n\n2023 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n53"}

The award was designed to retain Mr. Johnson in his role as president and ceo by providing compelling upside reward opportunity beyond the Company's regular executive compensation program for achieving exceptional shareholder returns. The award had a target value of $25 million but a payout under the award could only be earned if our relative TSR performance meaningfully outperformed the S&P 500 during the period beginning October 1, 2019, to September 30, 2022. Specifically, the award would have paid out at 100% of target if the Company's TSR performance relative to the companies comprising the S&P 500 index was at the 65th percentile, zero if performance was at the 40th percentile, and 200% of target if performance was at the 80th percentile, with linear interpolation between these points. At the end of fiscal 2022, Starbucks relative TSR was at the 25th percentile, resulting in no payout of the award.\n\n## Severance and CIC Plan\n\nIn August 2022, the Compensation Committee adopted the Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan (\"Severance and CIC Plan\") to facilitate the transformation and evolution of our executive leadership team and to align our executive compensation program more closely with market practices. Prior to adoption of the Severance and CIC Plan, we would from time-to-time offer severance benefit arrangements for terminated or separated executives as part of a negotiated termination of employment in exchange for a release of claims against the Company and other restrictive covenants. The Severance and CIC Plan was also adopted to provide uniformity and internal equity with respect to severance benefits among similarly situated executives and avoid protracted negotiations with departing executives.\n\nThe table below describes the material features of the Severance and CIC Plan and the Committee's rationale for the design of the Plan."}

Because Mr. Johnson was retirement eligible, his PRSUs and RSUs continued to vest under the terms of his existing award agreements. As discussed above, Mr. Johnson did not earn a cash incentive award, and he received the same payout of his fiscal 2019 PRSUs as other employees.

The Company maintains aircraft to facilitate business travel. The Company has adopted a comprehensive Corporate Aircraft Use Policy, including guidelines for annual reporting to the Audit Committee to ensure transparency relative to aircraft usage and the business purpose served. In accordance with the Corporate Aircraft Use Policy, the executive officers may enter into an aircraft time-sharing agreement, which allows them to use corporate aircraft for personal travel under the terms outlined in such aircraft time-sharing agreement between them and the Company. Personal use of the aircraft by an executive officer pursuant to the time-sharing agreement requires them to reimburse the Company for the operating expenses of such flights that is chargeable pursuant to Federal Aviation Regulations. The Company's Corporate Aircraft Use Policy allows for personal guests of executive officers and board members to travel on business-related flights on our corporate aircraft under certain limited circumstances. The policy also allows for certain executive personal travel done in connection with flight that is otherwise for a business-purpose. Both types of use result in imputed income to the executive or director under Internal Revenue Service regulations and, for NEOs, \"other compensation\" equal to the aggregate incremental costs to the Company resulting from such personal travel, which is reported in the Summary Compensation Table.\n\n- Security. We believe that the personal safety and security of our senior executives is of the utmost importance to the Company and its shareholders. Pursuant to our executive security program, we may from time to time provide personal security services to certain executives. Security services include home security systems and monitoring and, in some cases, personal security services. These protections are provided due to the range of security issues encountered by senior executives of large, multinational corporations and particularly with respect to high-profile executives. Based on a security study, the Company made the decision to provide personal security services to Mr. Schultz due to security considerations arising from his role as our interim chief executive officer and his significant visibility as our founder. We view the security services provided to Mr. Schultz as an integral part of our risk management program and as necessary and appropriate business expenses, given his importance to Starbucks. However, because such services may be viewed as conveying a personal benefit to Mr. Schultz, we have reported the aggregate incremental costs of such services in the \"All Other Compensation\" column of the Summary Compensation Table.\n\n- The Company did not pay personal security costs for any other executive in fiscal 2022, except in connection with business-related travel."}

The policy became effective, with respect to equity awards, beginning with awards granted in fiscal 2010 and, with respect to annual cash incentive awards, beginning with awards earned for fiscal 2010. In addition, since November 2017, our program provides for forfeiture of unvested equity awards as well as clawbacks of vested amounts and awards in the event the Company determines an executive has engaged in material misconduct, including willful and intentional failure to perform responsibilities, material failure to comply with Company rules, policies, or procedures, and personal conduct that is detrimental to the Company.\n\nOn October 26, 2022, the SEC adopted long-awaited final rules implementing the incentive- based compensation recovery provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rules direct the stock exchanges to establish listing standards requiring listed companies to develop and implement a policy providing for the recovery of erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation received by current or former executive officers and to satisfy related disclosure obligations. We intend to timely amend and restate our clawback policy to reflect these new requirements.\n\n61\n\n## Equity Grant Timing Practices\n\nMost of our equity grants occur on pre-established dates pursuant to our equity grant guidelines, with annual grants generally occurring on the later of the second business day after the public release of fiscal year-end earnings, or, if later, the final day of the board of directors' November meeting. Annual awards for executives are granted pursuant to a formula based on a specified dollar amount, with the number of shares and exercise price for each option grant determined based on the closing market price of our stock on the grant date and the number of shares for each RSU and PRSU grant determined by dividing the dollar amount by the closing market price of our stock on the grant date. The Compensation Committee approves annual awards for partners at the executive vice president level and above. The Compensation Committee has delegated authority to the interim chief executive and evp, Partner Resources to make annual grants, within certain parameters, to partners at the senior vice president level and below, and to newly hired or newly promoted partners below the executive officer level. All other new hire and promotion grants at the executive vice president level and above are approved by the Compensation Committee."}

In contrast, the nondairy milk market, including oat, coconut, soy, and almond milks, is projected to grow from over $25 billion in 2022 to over $61 billion by 2029. Three major factors are driving the demand for nondairy milk: taste, lactose intolerance, and environmental concerns\n\nResearch shows that 82% of people who consume plant-based milk do so because they prefer the taste.\n\nWhile many people prefer nondairy milk over cow's milk, other individuals can't tolerate cow's milk at all: 95% of Asian, 80 to 100% of Native American, 60 to 80% of Black, and 50 to 80% of Latinx populations suffer from lactose intolerance Nonwhites currently comprise nearly 40% of the U.S. population, and that segment is growing, which means that increasing numbers of Americans may hesitate to visit Starbucks or order drinks that include milk because of our current upcharge on nondairy milk.\n\nApproximately 56% of surveyed individuals who choose nondairy milk do so because of environmental concerns. Starbucks has publicly disclosed that dairy milk is the biggest contributor to our company's carbon footprint and the second-highest contributor to water usage. Cattle, including dairy COWS, account for roughly 40% of all greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture; plant-based milks produce less than one-third of CO2 emissions It takes 144 gallons of water to produce just 1 gallon of dairy milk; nondairy milks require up to 90% less water.\n\nStarbucks has committed to increasing plant-based options as a way of investing in an environmentally friendly menu. It is reasonable for shareholders to request an analysis of the potential costs to our company of the current upcharge on nondairy milk with regard to public relations and lost sales. Accordingly, we urge all shareholders to support this resolution."}

In April 2022, former CEO Kevin Johnson retired and Howard Schultz returned as Interim CEO while the Board searched for a permanent replacement. In explaining Starbucks' external search, Schultz told a reporter, \"For the future of the company, we need a domain of experience and expertise in a number of disciplines that we don't have now.\" While there may be circumstances where an external candidate is the best choice, not having any viable internal candidates is evidence of the Board's weak succession planning.\n\nReportedly, the Board was notified of Johnson's pending retirement at least one year in advance. Poor succession planning resulted in Starbucks losing a critical component of a smooth transition: business continuity. Rather than Johnson playing a large role in the onboarding of a successor, Laxman Narasimhan spent months shadowing Schultz who was retired for five years before his recent return. Adding to the bumpy transition, Schultz launched a \"Reinvention Plan\" that included changes to Starbucks strategy and leadership structure prior to Narasimhan's start.²\n\nAn effective succession planning process includes the regular evaluation of skills and competencies needed in a successor, identification of promising internal candidates, and a talent development strategy. A dynamic policy would better equip Starbucks for an emergency or planned succession with capable internal candidates and a candidate profile to expedite an external search. Developing a robust leadership pipeline has a myriad of benefits including retained institutional knowledge and increased employee morale and retention. The current policy is lacking, and we fear the Board is overly reliant on Schultz, as this was his second return.\n\nResearch suggests that poorly planned successions and external successors negatively impact financial performance. A 2006 study found that delays in hiring a successor and recruiting externally decreased subsequent financial performance. Research published in the Harvard Business Review in 2021 suggests that CEOs hired internally could perform better than external hires 61% of the time.4 A 2001 study found that hiring externally following a CEO retirement precipitated a nearly 6% drop in performance. Given these risks, Starbucks would benefit from a robust succession planning policy that produces viable internal candidates going forward.\n\n- 1 https://www.wsj.com/articles/howard-schultz-says-starbucks-is-seeking-fresh-blood-in-ceo-search-11654488060\n\n- 2 htps://www.restaurantdive.com/news/Starbucks-eliminates-COO-role/630060/;https:/investor.starbucks.com/press-releases/financial-releases/press-release-details/2022/Starbucks-Enters\new-Era-of-Growth-Driven-by-an-Unparalleled-Reinvention-Plan/default.aspx\n\n- 3 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287508898_Deaths_of_CEOs_Are_delays_in_naming_successors_and_insideroutsider_succession_associated_with_subsequent_firm_performan\n\n4 ps://hbr.org/2021/05/the-high-cost-of-poor-succession-planning\n\n- 5 https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/leadership-the-performance-impact-of-new-ceos/\n\n## BOARD RECOMMENDATION\n\nThe Starbucks board of directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons:\n\nOur Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our board of directors reviewed proponent's proposal and directed our general counsel and our corporate secretary to propose revisions to our Corporate Governance Principles and Practices for the Board of Directors (our \"Governance Principles\") that would consider suggestions made in the proposal.

It is now subject to the Uyghur Forced labor Prevention Act, which imposes strict verification of parts and products imported from China, that they are not generated from slave labor.\n\nStarbucks's extensive ties to China breed reputational risk for the company also. For example, while the company funds groups that promote the interests of homosexual and transgender individuals, the Communist government persistently and vigorously cracks down on those forms of identity within its borders.\n\nA July 2022 joint statement from the leaders of the British and American domestic intelligence agencies warned that the Communist Chinese Party is the greatest threat to the international order. \"We consistently see that it's the Chinese government that poses the biggest long-term threat to our economic and national security, and by our,' I mean both of our nations, along with our allies in Europe and elsewhere,\" said FBI Director Christopher Wray.\n\nGiven the controversial, if not dangerous, nature of doing business in and with China, shareholders have the right to know the extent to which Starbucks Corporation's business operations\n\ndepend on Communist China."}

According to the International Labour Organization, \"Freedom of association refers to the right of workers to create and join organizations of their choice freely and without fear of reprisal or interference\" and collective bargaining \"allows workers to negotiate their working conditions freely with their employers.\"\n\nIn the U.S., many workers allege that Starbucks has interfered with these rights, including retaliation, intimidation, firings, captive audience meetings, store closings, undue surveillance, and illegally excluding unionized employees from wage and benefit increases-generating negative media coverage. Workers at hundreds of stores have voted to unionize, and regional offices of the National Labor Relations Board, after finding merit to hundreds of allegations of labor rights violations, have issued at least 20 complaints against Starbucks.2\n\nIn August 2022, a U.S. judge ordered Starbucks to reinstate seven Memphis, Tennessee employees who were allegedly fired for supporting an organizing campaign. 3 Also in August, the labor board requested that Howard Schultz read a notice to all employees informing them that some had been unlawfully denied benefits and pay increases.4\n\nWe believe the apparent misalignment between Starbucks' public commitments and its reported conduct represents material reputational, legal, and operational risks and may impact its long- term value. As Starbucks' 2021 10-K states \"our responses to any organizing efforts could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and have adverse effects on our business, including on our financial results.\" Failing to respect workers' rights could harm Starbucks reputation with consumers and hurt its ability to attract and retain a high-performing workforce, a crucial element of its ability to provide quality products and service. Research shows that union membership may have a positive effect on retention, in some cases, reducing resignations by as much as 65%.5 Studies show companies spend approximately 20% of an employee's salary to replace them.6\n\nGreater transparency on these issues could help address concerns about associated risks, and enable investors to perform human rights due diligence and assess Starbucks' adherence to its human rights commitments.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\t- https:/www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/04/new-york-starbucks-closed-union-drive; https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/business/economy/starbucks-union-howard-schultz\nnlrb.html\n\n- https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/starbucks-alleges-labor-board-misconduct-union-elections-us-cafes-2022-08-15;https://www.law360.com/employment-\nauthority/starbucks-tracker;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/06/starbucks-accused-of-more-than-200-labor-violations-in-nlrb-complaint.html https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/labor-\nboard-files-complaint-against-starbucks-for-withholding-raises-from-unionized-stores;https://www.nirb.gov/about-nlrb/what-we-do/investig\n\n\t- 3 s://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/starbucks-ordered-reinstate-workers-fired-amid-union-campaign-2022-08-184\n\n\t- 4 https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/business/economy/starbucks-union-howard-schultz-nlrb.html\n\n5\n\n- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226530917_The_Impact_of_Union_Membership_on_Intent_to_Leave_Additional_Evidence_on_the_Voice_Face_of_Union\n\n- 6 https://www.americanprogress.org/article/there-are-significant-business-costs-to-replacing-employees/"}

Human rights in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights include the U.N. Universal Declaration on Human Rights as well as the 1998 International Labour Organization Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (referred to as the \"1998 Declaration\"). The 1998 Declaration includes the principle of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, among other fundamental labor rights. These principles, as they are defined at the international level, are highly nuanced and manifest themselves through the application of a nation's laws. U.S. labor law conforms to these principles; specifically, U.S. labor law reflects the principle that workers have the right to select a representative of their own choosing and, implicit in that principle, is the right of workers to choose not to be represented by a labor organization. Moreover, a cornerstone principle of U.S. labor law provides that all parties, including employers, have the right to freedom of expression and opinion in connection with union organizing efforts, provided there is no interference with this fundamental right. The ILO's Committee on Freedom of Association has confirmed that employers enjoy such a right.\n\nStarbucks contends that it complies with U.S. law with respect to freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. It should be noted that the current General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board has taken policy measures to expand and enhance U.S. law beyond previously established precedent. This policy shift has coincided with efforts of some Starbucks partners to seek union representation, which commenced in Buffalo, New York and has extended elsewhere in the country, impacting approximately 3% of Starbucks stores. Throughout this process, Starbucks has endeavored to comply with the law and we are committed to ensuring that it continue to do so. To the extent claims have been brought against Starbucks for violation of labor laws, the company has committed to defend itself where it believes the allegations are unfounded. To date, Starbucks has not been found to have violated the law as part of any enforced Order of the National Labor Relations Board."}

For example, the NLRB pursued injunctive relief in Federal Court in Arizona that the court denied, concluding that the NLRB did not have a likelihood of success on the merits, in part, because the NLRB premised its filing on testimony that was later found to be untrue. Likewise, an NLRB administrative law judge recently issued a decision in which the complaint filed by the NLRB General Counsel against Starbucks was dismissed. One NLRB official has reported to the agency's Inspector General that the agency's handling of Starbucks representation elections has been done in a way that is biased in favor of supporters of the union. This is contrary to the law, which confers upon employees the right to form, join, or assist a labor organization, or to refrain from doing so. The NLRB Inspector General has publicly announced his investigation into these reports.\n\nMoreover, where partners have selected a labor organization as their exclusive representative, Starbucks has committed to comply with the law and the rights of its partners to engage in collective bargaining.\n\nWhile we do not believe or agree that the independent, third-party assessment advanced by the proponent is necessary or in the best interest of Starbucks, its shareholders, or its partners, we recognize that Starbucks commitment to respect human rights within the framework of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights comes with the corresponding expectation that the company undertake human rights due diligence. Starbucks has commenced efforts to conduct a human rights impact assessment as a process to identify, assess, and address the company's most salient human rights impacts across the value chain. In developing the scope for the Starbucks human rights impact assessment, the company expects to prioritize salient human rights for deeper level review. To that end, labor rights principles outlined in the 1998 Declaration, including the principles of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, will be included in that process. As part of Starbucks commitment to transparency with respect to our global social and environmental impacts, we expect to make available the results of Starbucks human rights impact assessment to shareholders, stakeholders, and other interested parties.

It subsequently instituted sweeping policy changes by introducing a \"third place policy\" that invited non-customers to enjoy using Starbucks facilities, including its bathrooms, despite not making a single purchase. In doing so, Starbucks invited the exact behavior that it now laments as the cause of its store closures. Worse yet, the company flat out ignored an independent academic study that found that Starbucks open bathroom policy was hurting its bottom-line.\n\nChanging company policy to now permit individual stores to make their own decisions as to whether to have an open bathroom policy is an important first step in addressing the decisions that led to the safety concerns experienced in the first place, but it is just that, a first step.10 Reflecting upon the company's policy positions and advocacy decisions-and assessing how they have contributed to its need to close stores due to safety issues is therefore necessary to keep additional stores from closing and to protect shareholders."}

The closure of 16 stores does not materially impact our business, but it does exemplify our commitment to the safety of our partners.\n\nAccordingly, because the Starbucks board of directors and its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee have effective oversight over sustainability issues and have disclosed our commitment to further our efforts with intention, transparency, and accountability publicly, including through the GESI Report and the CRA, the board of directors does not believe that establishing a separate corporate sustainability committee is necessary to properly exercise its oversight of this important area, nor would such a commitment add to Starbucks existing commitment to corporate sustainability.\n\nThe board of directors recommends that our shareholders vote against this proposal.\n\n## Board Recommendation\n\nThe board of directors recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal.\n\n2023 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n85"}
