The Compensation Committee generally sets target total direct compensation for our executives to be competitive with peer companies and other market data and takes into consideration scope of job responsibilities, individual performance of the executive, and other factors. The Compensation Committee's executive compensation determinations are based on its review of such factors and are informed by the experiences of the members of the Compensation Committee as well as input from, and peer group data provided by, the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant\n\nThe market data considered by the Committee as part of the annual pay-setting process reflects compensation levels and practices for executives holding comparable positions at peer group companies and includes broader compensation survey data.\n\nThe Compensation Committee, with assistance from its independent compensation consultant, annually reviews the composition of our peer group. As part of such reviews, the Committee considers specific criteria and recommendations regarding companies to add or remove from the peer group. The industries from which we select our peer group companies consist of consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and information technology-software and services companies. From those industries, the Committee selected a peer group that includes global companies with complex management needs and strong brand profiles. For fiscal 2022, the Committee modified the 2021 peer group by removing The Home Depot, Inc. and Yum! Brands, Inc., and adding Kimberly-Clark Corporation and Mondelez International, Inc.\n\nThe Compensation Committee and independent directors considered the peer group in connection with their fiscal 2022 target total direct compensation decisions.
