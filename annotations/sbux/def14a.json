We are meeting them where they are, whether that's a Cold Brew on the go from a Pick-Up store, a quiet moment with a cappuccino inside one of our caf\u00e9s, or a deep-dive into coffee education with a workshop at our new Starbucks Reserve location at the Empire State Building. For our partners, we are equipping them with better tools and training and have committed more than $1 billion in partner and store experience investments We are bringing coffee excellence, coffee craft, and joy and a little bit of love back into being a Starbucks barista.\n\nOver the past year, we have seen that the demand the prior year to a record $32.3 billion, driven by phenomenal 8 percent global growth in comparable store sales. Starbucks International continues to drive growth for the company, and we expect two-thirds of global retail growth over the next three years to come from our international business As we continue to navigate the COVID pandemic and its impacts in China, we are focused on supporting our partners and leaders in the market and look forward to a bright future ahead.\n\nOur impact at Starbucks ripples on a global scale. We take this responsibility seriously and strive to make a positive difference in the lives of the people we serve and the planet we share. We believe that every partner and every customer should have a sense of belonging at Starbucks, and should be able to be their authentic selves every day. We are dedicated to advancing racial and social equity, and we are committed to furthering that work with intention, transparency, and accountability. We are striving to be a resource-positive company, to give back more of the planet's resources than we consume. To help us get there, we have clear and ambitious sustainability targets to reduce our carbon, water, and waste footprints in half by 2030. Additionally, we are integrating sustainability throughout our Reinvention efforts, working to ensure we are considering the impacts to sustainability with each one of our strategies.\n\n## Onward\n\nThe new fiscal year also marks a new chapter with incoming ceo, Laxman Narasimhan. Since joining the company in October, he has been traveling around the world and immersing in our company and culture. Each day we have together, including time in Origin with our extended leadership team this Fall in Hacienda Alcasia, Costa Rica, we are reminded he is an extraordinary global citizen and servant leader who is embracing the vision of Starbucks in his own way.\n\nWe are both so proud of the company Starbucks is today and will be tomorrow, and profoundly grateful to the more than 400,000 Starbucks partners who are a part of this great odyssey. We would also like to extend our appreciation to the Starbucks Board of Directors for their leadership and support during this time of reinvention and renewal. We are laying the foundation for the future of a Starbucks even more true to our shared mission: To inspire and nurture the human spirit - one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.\n\nWith respect and gratitude,\n\n(hssignature21-\n04a.gif\n\nHoward Schultz\nchief executive officer\n\nMellody Hobson\nindependent chair of the board\n\n*Growth rate is based on a 52-week basis.

Our shared vision2 is a better future for each other, our customers and the communities we serve. We invest in our partners because we know that when we put them first-and work to exceed their expectations-the result is a great experience for our customers and communities. Our world- class benefits are designed to meet the needs of our partners in our different markets and are generally available to full- and part-time partners. In the U.S., those benefits include comprehensive health coverage, mental health benefits, retirement plans with company match, Bean Stock, our equity reward program, 100 percent tuition coverage for a first-time bachelor's degree and more.3\n\nStarbucks took significant action in fiscal 2022 to improve our partners' experience through increased wages, additional training, and comprehensive benefits. Our wage increases and training program expansion for U.S. retail partners in fiscal 2022 totaled $1 billion, and we updated our family expansion reimbursement benefit, while also introducing access to financial well-being tools and the opportunity to accrue sick time at a faster rate.\n\nStarbucks effort to improve our partners' experience is founded on a deep commitment to advance inclusion, diversity, and equity-and the belief that we are at our best when we create inclusive and welcoming environments, where we uplift one another with dignity, respect, and kindness We are committed to hiring from communities that may face barriers to employment, including people of color, Veterans and military spouses; people who are in LGBTQIA+ communities; and those who are disabled. Starbucks aims to achieve and maintain gender pay equity in all global company-operated markets annually, in addition to racial pay equity in the United States. We commit to transparent data collection and reporting on our hiring practices, partner demographics, and partner support initiatives to hold us accountable as we continue to build a diverse and inclusive company. For example, Starbucks began publishing regular Civil Rights Assessments4 in 2019 to address our progress and present recommendations for reaching new heights in our work to develop and sustain an inclusive, diverse workforce.", "blocks": [{"type": "Section Header", "bbox": {"left": 0.0546218487394958, "top": 0.19418052256532067, "width": 0.3588235294117647, "height": 0.009501187648456057, "page": 17}, "content": "PRIORITY 1: INVESTING IN OUR PARTNERS"}, {"type": "Text", "bbox": {"left": 0.05378151260504202, "top": 0.21258907363420426, "width": 0.8840336134453781, "height": 0.043942992874109264, "page": 17}, "content": "At Starbucks, we are working side-by-side with partners to create meaningful change.

In addition, partners participate in ongoing mandatory annual trainings and receive communications regarding the cybersecurity environment to increase awareness throughout the Company. Our Audit Committee, which oversees data privacy and cybersecurity risk matters, is comprised entirely of independent directors, one of whom has significant work experience related to information security issues and oversight. Management will report security instances to the Audit Committee as they occur, if material, and will also provide a summary multiple times per year to the Audit Committee Additionally, our chief information security officer meets at least twice annually with the board of directors or the Audit Committee to brief them on technology and information security matters. We carry insurance that provides protection against the potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident. In the last three years, the expenses we have incurred from information security breach incidences were immaterial. This includes penalties and settlements, of which there were none.\n\n## Shareholder Engagement\n\nWe have a year-round shareholder outreach program through which we solicit feedback on diverse business areas, ranging from our executive compensation program and corporate governance practices to disclosure practices and environmental and social impact programs and goals. We share feedback we receive with our board of directors, as well as other board committees such as the Compensation Committee and the Nominating/Governance Committee, as appropriate. Our board considers feedback received from shareholders throughout the year, and such input influences changes to our compensation program and the adoption of new governance practices. Every year, our outreach effort is conducted by a cross-functional team including: Investor Relations, Law & Corporate Affairs, Inclusion and Diversity, Public Affairs, Global Coffee, Sustainability and Social Impact, and Partner Resources Organization. Additionally, our ceo and cfo are engaged in meaningful dialogue with our shareholders through our quarterly earnings calls and investor-related outreach events. For more information about our shareholder engagement, see page 11.\n\n## ROLE OF OUR BOARD COMMITTEES\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, our board of directors had three standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating/Governance Committee.

Johnson as president and chief executive officer, and the appointment of Starbucks founder, Howard Schultz, as interim chief executive officer in April 2022. Our board of directors selected Mr. Schultz based on his role in building Starbucks into one of the world's most recognized and respected businesses, a company focused on delivering best-in-class financial performance, through exceeding the expectations of our people and our customers Under his leadership, Starbucks grew from 11 stores with 100 partners to more than 28,000 stores in 77 countries, and he pioneered programs like comprehensive healthcare, stock ownership, and free college tuition for full and part-time partners.\n\nAdditional leadership and organizational changes followed in fiscal 2022, which concluded with the appointment of Laxman Narasimhan, as chief executive officer-elect in October 2022. Mr. Narasimhan is expected to be appointed as our permanent chief executive officer in April 2023. Mr. Narasimhan brings nearly 30 years of experience leading and advising global consumer- facing brands. Known for his considerable operational expertise, he has a proven track record in developing purpose-led brands, and building on companies histories, he has succeeded in rallying talent to deliver on future ambitions by driving consumer-centric and digital innovations.\n\nGuided by Mr. Schultz and our partners, in fiscal 2022, we began to implement our Reinvention Plan, an inspired roadmap to build the future of Starbucks, while staying true to our mission of uplifting communities through a shared love for coffee and further extending our coffee leadership and innovation. Starbucks partners are at the core of the Reinvention Plan, and we are committed to investing in our partner base through recruiting, training, and onboarding initiatives. As part of the Reinvention Plan, we also are continuing to unlock the intersection of convenience and connection by introducing enhancements to the customer experience across the retail and digital realms.

At our 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. approximately 92.4% of our shareholders who cast votes supported our advisory vote on executive compensation. In addition, every year, we engage with shareholders representing a significant portion of our outstanding shares on a variety of topics, including our executive compensation program. During 2022, as part of our regular shareholder outreach, we engaged with our top shareholders, representing nearly 30% of our total shares outstanding. The shareholders with whom we engaged generally expressed support for our executive compensation program, and were also supportive of the meaningful enhancements that we made to our program in fiscal 2022, which included, among other things, clarifying that the non-financial individual performance factor portion of our Annual Incentive Bonus Plan would be weighted at 30% in the aggregate, and providing for more formulaic payout metrics for ESG goals.\n\nIn evaluating our compensation practices for fiscal 2023, the Compensation Committee was mindful of the feedback provided by shareholders and continued to refine our Annual Incentive Bonus Plan to more closely align compensation with company financial performance and further demonstrate our commitment to value creation for shareholders, including an increased focus on sales and earnings given the effects of COVID-19, supply chain and materials costs, potential difficulties in China, and the Company's transformation in connection with our Reinvention Plan. Beginning with the fiscal 2023 Annual Incentive Bonus Plan, 70% of each participant's target incentive opportunity will be earned based on adjusted net revenue and adjusted operating income financial metrics, increased from 50% and the remaining 30% will be earned based on ESG metrics (15% increased from 10% in fiscal 2022) and individual performance (15% decreased from 30% in fiscal 2022). Profit specific goals, which included operating margin, comparable store sales, and net new stores, were eliminated from the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan as the Compensation Committee determined that performance against these metrics was largely reflected in the adjusted net revenue and adjusted operating income metrics and wanted to focus and simplify the plan, as described in more detail below in the section entitled \"2023 Executive Compensation.\"\n\n2023 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n41\n\n## Fiscal 2022 Target Total Direct Compensation\n\nThe vast majority of our NEOs' target total direct compensation is in the form of compensation that is variable or \"at-risk\" based on our financial, operating, and ESG performance and the value of our stock price.

We offer a comprehensive benefits package to all eligible full- and part-time partners in the U.S. and locally competitive benefits packages in other countries. In addition to our equity incentive plans discussed above, we offer an employee stock purchase plan to partners in the U.S. and Canada that allows participants to purchase Starbucks stock at a 5% discount to the fair market value at the end of each offering period under the plan. We believe our Total Rewards practices motivate our executives to build long-term shareholder value and reward the partners who take care of our customers.\n\n- Broad-Based \"Bean Stock\" Program: A long-term incentive grant of time-based RSUs was made in November 2021 to approximately 223,000 eligible non-executive partners in 21 markets around the world, including part-time partners. We refer to this broad-based equity program as our \"Bean Stock\" program. Bean Stock participants include those partners who work in our stores and serve our customers directly. In fiscal 2022, Bean Stock participants realized approximately $132 million in pre-tax gains from previously granted Bean Stock awards.\n\n- Future Roast 401(k) Savings Plan: Available to all U.S. partners who are at least age 18 with 90 days of service. The Starbucks Match within the 401(k) is 100% of the first 5% of eligible compensation contributed each pay period. The match is immediately fully vested and is contributed to each participant's 401(k) account each pay period along with the participant's contributions. In fiscal 2022, Starbucks contributed more than $146 million in matching contributions.\n\n- Insurance Coverage for Partners: For more than 30 years, Starbucks has provided health insurance coverage for partners working 20 hours or more a week. Starbucks also provides life and disability insurance to eligible partners.\n\n- College Achievement Plan: The Starbucks College Achievement Plan was launched in fiscal 2014. It provides eligible partners in the U.S. with the opportunity to earn a first-time bachelor's degree online from Arizona State University with 100% upfront tuition coverage. Additionally, our military service member and Veteran partners can extend an additional Starbucks College Achievement Plan benefit to a qualifying family member of their choice. As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023, nearly 10,000 partners had graduated with degrees, and more than 23,000 partners were participating in the Starbucks College Achievement Plan.\n\n- Paid Sick Time, Vacation, Holiday, and Parental Leave: Starbucks is an industry leader in paid sick time and parental leave and has competitive policies for vacation and holiday pay.\n\n- Partner Assistance: Our CUP Fund gives financial assistance to Starbucks partners in times of special need due to illness, death in the family, natural disasters, or other extreme circumstances.\n\n- Partner Financial Well Being: My Starbucks Savings enables eligible partners to save directly from their paycheck for emergencies and other financial needs. Starbucks provides an incentive to eligible partners at key milestones in their savings journey. Starbucks Student Loan Management program provides a platform for eligible Starbucks partners to manage their student loans. Both programs were launched in September 2022.\n\nThe above benefits specifically apply in the U.S., but we generally strive to provide similar benefits in all countries while considering the social coverage programs available in each country.\n\nExecutives are eligible to participate in all benefit plans we offer to partners generally.

At the time of making the deferral election for a particular year, a participant elects when the associated deferred compensation will be distributed. In general, the participant can receive scheduled \"in-service\" withdrawals or hardship withdrawals while still employed or have distributions paid upon separation from service. The specific distribution options depend on whether the deferred compensation was earned before or after January 1, 2005, and is subject to other plan rules.\n\nFor separation from service distributions, account balances resulting from the Company match and deferred compensation earned on and after January 1, 2005, can be paid either in a lump sum or in up to 10 annual installments, in each case beginning within 60 days or one year after separation from service. For partners who became newly eligible on or after October 1, 2010, and certain other partners, separation from service distributions can be paid either in a lump sum or amortized over a period of two to five years, in each case beginning within 60 days or one year after separation from service.

For this reason, and because each partner's relationship with our industry-leading total rewards offerings differs based on individual circumstances, we have not ascribed a value to healthcare or the other benefits provided to our partners. This allows total compensation of the median partner to represent the median of all partners based on elements of compensation shared generally among our partners worldwide. For more information regarding our total rewards philosophy, please see the Investing in Our Partners (Our Total Rewards Philosophy) section in the CD&A of this proxy statement on page 60.\n\nConsistent with the methodology utilized for the fiscal 2021 calculation, we identified our median employee from all full-time and part-time partners regardless of status who were on our payroll records as of a determination date of October 2, 2022, based on base wages paid during the twelve-month period ending on that date. For permanent partners hired during the twelve-month period, compensation was annualized to reflect a full year of wages. Compensation for international employees was converted to U.S. dollar equivalents applying an average exchange rate for the fiscal year.

In contrast, the nondairy milk market, including oat, coconut, soy, and almond milks, is projected to grow from over $25 billion in 2022 to over $61 billion by 2029.

In April 2022, former CEO Kevin Johnson retired and Howard Schultz returned as Interim CEO while the Board searched for a permanent replacement. In explaining Starbucks' external search, Schultz told a reporter, \"For the future of the company, we need a domain of experience and expertise in a number of disciplines that we don't have now.\" While there may be circumstances where an external candidate is the best choice, not having any viable internal candidates is evidence of the Board's weak succession planning.\n\nReportedly, the Board was notified of Johnson's pending retirement at least one year in advance. Poor succession planning resulted in Starbucks losing a critical component of a smooth transition: business continuity. Rather than Johnson playing a large role in the onboarding of a successor, Laxman Narasimhan spent months shadowing Schultz who was retired for five years before his recent return. Adding to the bumpy transition, Schultz launched a \"Reinvention Plan\" that included changes to Starbucks strategy and leadership structure prior to Narasimhan's start.\u00b2\n\nAn effective succession planning process includes the regular evaluation of skills and competencies needed in a successor, identification of promising internal candidates, and a talent development strategy. A dynamic policy would better equip Starbucks for an emergency or planned succession with capable internal candidates and a candidate profile to expedite an external search. Developing a robust leadership pipeline has a myriad of benefits including retained institutional knowledge and increased employee morale and retention. The current policy is lacking, and we fear the Board is overly reliant on Schultz, as this was his second return.\n\nResearch suggests that poorly planned successions and external successors negatively impact financial performance. A 2006 study found that delays in hiring a successor and recruiting externally decreased subsequent financial performance. Research published in the Harvard Business Review in 2021 suggests that CEOs hired internally could perform better than external hires 61% of the time.4 A 2001 study found that hiring externally following a CEO retirement precipitated a nearly 6% drop in performance. Given these risks, Starbucks would benefit from a robust succession planning policy that produces viable internal candidates going forward.\n\n- 1 https://www.wsj.com/articles/howard-schultz-says-starbucks-is-seeking-fresh-blood-in-ceo-search-11654488060\n\n- 2 htps://www.restaurantdive.com/news/Starbucks-eliminates-COO-role/630060/;https:/investor.starbucks.com/press-releases/financial-releases/press-release-details/2022/Starbucks-Enters\new-Era-of-Growth-Driven-by-an-Unparalleled-Reinvention-Plan/default.aspx\n\n- 3 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287508898_Deaths_of_CEOs_Are_delays_in_naming_successors_and_insideroutsider_succession_associated_with_subsequent_firm_performan\n\n4 ps://hbr.org/2021/05/the-high-cost-of-poor-succession-planning\n\n- 5 https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/leadership-the-performance-impact-of-new-ceos/\n\n## BOARD RECOMMENDATION\n\nThe Starbucks board of directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons:\n\nOur Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our board of directors reviewed proponent's proposal and directed our general counsel and our corporate secretary to propose revisions to our Corporate Governance Principles and Practices for the Board of Directors (our \"Governance Principles\") that would consider suggestions made in the proposal.

According to the International Labour Organization, \"Freedom of association refers to the right of workers to create and join organizations of their choice freely and without fear of reprisal or interference\" and collective bargaining \"allows workers to negotiate their working conditions freely with their employers.\"\n\nIn the U.S., many workers allege that Starbucks has interfered with these rights, including retaliation, intimidation, firings, captive audience meetings, store closings, undue surveillance, and illegally excluding unionized employees from wage and benefit increases-generating negative media coverage. Workers at hundreds of stores have voted to unionize, and regional offices of the National Labor Relations Board, after finding merit to hundreds of allegations of labor rights violations, have issued at least 20 complaints against Starbucks.2\n\nIn August 2022, a U.S. judge ordered Starbucks to reinstate seven Memphis, Tennessee employees who were allegedly fired for supporting an organizing campaign. 3 Also in August, the labor board requested that Howard Schultz read a notice to all employees informing them that some had been unlawfully denied benefits and pay increases.4\n\nWe believe the apparent misalignment between Starbucks' public commitments and its reported conduct represents material reputational, legal, and operational risks and may impact its long- term value.

We believe Starbucks can, and should, have a positive impact on the communities we serve and that our employees-our partners-are at the heart of the Starbucks experience. As a board, it is our responsibility to ensure that Starbucks business and affairs are managed to meet Starbucks stated goals and objectives and that long-term interests of shareholder are served. Part of that responsibility includes working with management and our partners to invest in our partners health, well-being, and success and to create a culture of belonging that is centered around putting our partners first and where everyone is welcome.\n\nWe are proud of our investments in our Starbucks partners:\n\n- We provide the highest-rated benefits in the country for full- and part-time hourly workers (including medical coverage and stock benefits).\n\n- We offer competitive pay - with a minimum of $15/hour and average pay across our company-owned U.S. stores that is nearing $17.50/hour.\n\nSince 1991, our Bean Stock program has provided our partners the opportunity to share in the financial success of the company through shares of our stock-it's the reason our employees\n\nare called partners.\n\n2023 PROXY STATEMENT\n\n81\n\n## SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS\n\n- We are broadening health insurance options, providing 100% upfront tuition coverage for college tuition through the Starbucks College Achievement Plan with Arizona State University, providing mental health services at no cost, and recently introduced a new suite of financial well-being benefits for our U.S. partners.\n\n- To make our partners' days run more smoothly, we're improving the way our 'behind the bar' space is organized so it's easier to navigate during busy times, creating easy processes for partners to sign up for and trade shifts to fit their schedules, and working to improve staffing at busy stores.\n\nStarbucks partners' voices and concerns are top priority for both management and this board-we are listening. We continue to believe that, together with our partners, we can build a company defined by dignity and respect for each other and our planet. We are united in the shared purpose of uplifting the partner experience today and for years to come.\n\nOn November 17, 2020, Kevin Johnson, our then chief executive officer, issued our Global Human Rights Statement Our Global Human Rights Statement is an extension of our mission: to inspire and nurture the human spirit - one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.
